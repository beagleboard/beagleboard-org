    <body>Whereabouts are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/cheapest-fertility-pharmacy-bf28.pdf#arouse&quot;&gt;online pharmacy lithuania&lt;/a&gt;  God will judge among us. As for those ignorant enough who blame the religion for war, before you begin, let them look at their books first. Every Muslim knows that killing any innocent human being or any living creature, is an eternal aggression to life and an offense to hell in the holy Qur&amp;#8217;an revellation from God, but they still do it. People are people, forgetful and foolish under the wrong circumstances. Any excuse can give people incentive to separate and then kill eachother. WWI; 20 million killed eachother, the 2nd; 60 million, in the most horrifying ways.. No religion involved. . total; 80 million in 8 years. Hiroshima, Nagasaki; almost half a million direct deaths, more than a million in th aftermath, religion? no. The Japanese massacred Millions of Chinese before. Communists in Stalin&amp;#8217;s Russia, you do the search, unbelievable. Cold war, we were a hair close to extinction by a nuclear conflict. Today, nobody knows, everyone has nuclear capabilities, especially those who used it before to prove carbon based muscles.
