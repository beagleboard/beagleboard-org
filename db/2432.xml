Watch the video to see how things escalated before, after and during his primary rally.

The country has suffered a series of brutal losses in the US courts, and there&amp;#8217;s no particular reason to believe that&amp;#8217;s going to change. But the Second Circuit did stay its ruling pending an appeal to the Supreme Court &amp;#8212; and there&amp;#8217;s even reasonably explicit language in the ruling hinting that the appeals court would actually welcome the Supreme Court taking this case. Much of Argentina&amp;#8217;s argument was based on the idea that the ruling violates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA); the Second Circuit decided that it doesn&amp;#8217;t, but only &amp;#8220;absent further guidance from the Supreme Court&amp;#8221;.

They still don&amp;#8217;t have the leadership including a fresh Board of Directors to move ahead instead of wallowing in their failure and missed opportunities. The creativity needed is already in place i.e. it e employees who are undervalued, mismanaged and blamed for the failures of the leadership and Board. Morale is so low it can crawl under the belly of an ant. It&amp;#8217;s time to reinvigorate and empower employees creating new products that will light a fire under what once was one of the finest and most creative companies in the world. The choice of Meg Whitman was not a wise one but what can be expected of a an ossified Board that lacks imagination and apparently also lacks business acumen. That is a double headed disaster that require urgent action but by whom? Shareholders are disempowered and there is nothing to stop the coming slide except, dare it be said, bankruptcy. What a shame to run this magical corporation into the ground.
