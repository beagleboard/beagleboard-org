    <body>I&apos;ve just started at  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/aydinmedcom-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;healthyschoolsnigeria.org&lt;/a&gt;  The Fed said its holdings of so-called &quot;other&quot; securities held in custody and reported at face value fell by $267 million to stand at $38.3 billion.
