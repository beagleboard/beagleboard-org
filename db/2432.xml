Figures released by China&apos;s National Bureau of Statistics on July 8 showed that the Chinese economy grew at a 7.5 percent rate year-over-year in the second quarter, off from its nearly 8 percent pace in the final quarter of 2012. China may grow at a 7.6 percent rate next year, if economists are correct in their forecasts.

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.
