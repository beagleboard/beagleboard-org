    <body>Thanks funny site &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/hillcrest-pharmacy-holland-park-opening-hours-6a83.pdf#limited&quot;&gt;hillcrest pharmacy hamilton nz&lt;/a&gt;  The last time I was in the flagship London store there was a life-size virtual catwalk show going on and what looked like a sculpture wall was actually a collection of accessories, all for sale. The music was pumping, the shop assistants were friendly, helpful and of course draped in the brand and, crucially, the place oozed cool. Ahrendts managed to take a British brand that was once considered the staple of the âchavâ and make it covetable once again.
