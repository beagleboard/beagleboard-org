    <body>How many more years do you have to go? &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/sildenafil-stada-100mg-filmtabletten-kaufen-6a83.pdf&quot;&gt;sildenafil stada 50mg kaufen&lt;/a&gt;  âThe F-16 and F-35 are apples and oranges,â Major Matt Johnston, 35, an air-force instructor at Eglin, told me. âItâs like comparing an Atari video-game system to the latest and greatest thing that Sony has come up with. Theyâre both aircraft, but the capabilities that the F-35 brings are completely revolutionary.â Johnston, like Berke, is evangelical about the airplane and insistent that âprogrammaticsââthe technological and political inner workings of the J.S.F. effortâare not his concern. He has a job to do, which is training pilots for the jet fighter that will someday be. He was candid about, but unfazed by, the F-35âs current limitations: the squadrons at Eglin are prohibited from flying at night, prohibited from flying at supersonic speed, prohibited from flying in bad weather (including within 25 miles of lightning), prohibited from dropping live ordnance, and prohibited from firing their guns. Then there is the matter of the helmet.
