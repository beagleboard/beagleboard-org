Last year it was the first to offer to send troops to eastern Congo under what will become a brigade of U.N. peacekeepers with a mandate to combat rebels groups there. Even before the deployment becomes fully operational, the brigade â which also includes troops from Malawi and South Africa â has been threatened by Congolese M23 rebels who say they will be forced to defend themselves if they are attacked by the peacekeepers.
