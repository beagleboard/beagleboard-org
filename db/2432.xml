    <body>I can&apos;t hear you very well &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/aboutdrugcom-a511.pdf&quot;&gt;family-drug-mart.com&lt;/a&gt;  Lindsay Burdge gives a sensitive performance as Diana, a Texas high school English teacher who, as the film begins, is involved in a passionate affair with a senior boy, Eric Tull (Will Brittain). Sheâs obsessed with Eric, risking her job and dismissing datable men who, like her, are in their upper 20s. But Eric seems to be just in it for the fling, and his casual disregard drives Diana closer to recklessness. Fidellâs mature style and Burdgeâs lack of guile are engaging. As the filmâs emotions grow darker, a lack of ideas comes through. Until then, though, itâs engrossing.
