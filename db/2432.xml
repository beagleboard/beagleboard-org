Maris himself started losing hair in clumps as he chased the mark of 60 held by Babe Ruth a half century ago, enduring hate mail and death threats along the way.

They look as desperate as Alex Rodriguez does these days, except these people on the street, his âsupporters,â are simply desperate for attention, cameras, getting their names in the newspaper; desperate to be noticed, even as they are most noticed for being like more pathetic props for Rodriguez.

What you perceive as baseball turning a blind eye to the return of the spitball is merely an attempt to speed up the pace of play. It used to be that not only could you not be on the rubber when you went to your mouth, but you had to be off of the dirt portion of the mound. Of course a lot of players in certain atmospheric conditions suffer from dry hands and have to go to their mouths to get rid of the slippery grip. Others cheat. That extra time under the old rule was killing the pace of play and so baseball mandated that you could actually be on the mound and go to your mouth if you at least made a gesture to wipe it off on your uniform before delivering the pitch. Do all pitchers wipe? Sketchy. As for sweaty foreheads, I agree with you that provides more lubrication than a quick lick of the fingertips. Fernando Rodney is one of those that takes a huge swipe of his sweaty brow and then pitches.
