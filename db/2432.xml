    <body>How much is a Second Class stamp? &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/astravar-20-vitamin-shoppe-7ef0.pdf&quot;&gt;top secret astravar 2.0 amplifier&lt;/a&gt;  Wilmut, emeritus professor at the MRC Center for Regenerative Medicine at University of Edinburgh, made headlines in 1996 when he and his colleagues cloned Dolly the sheep. Their technique involved injecting DNA into a special egg cell and transferring the product into a third sheep, which carried the egg to term. While Dolly lived a brief life, dying in 2003, her very existence was hailed as a medical marvel.

She has been defending victims of FGM since 1982, when a girl of Malian origin died after the procedure, sparking national outrage. More than 100 parents have been prosecuted, many have received jail sentences of up to two years. Two practitioners were given longer sentences. One of them, Hawa GrÃ©ou, who served five years, subsequently joined forces with her one-time adversary, Ms Weil-Curiel, to write a book on the thousands of girls mutilated in France each year. She says she will never harm a girl again.

Luckily for her.
