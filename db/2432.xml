    <body>I&apos;d like to open an account &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/medicalhscom-83f5.pdf&quot;&gt;orientanimalhealth.com&lt;/a&gt;  âWhilst we recognise that, in order to facilitate the passage of the Directive, the question of legal aid was removed from consideration and postponed to a later date, progress on legal aid cannot be delayed indefinitely. Without legal aid, the enjoyment of other protected rights may remain elusive in practice. The UN Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems were adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2012, placing legal aid high on the global agenda. We therefore urge the Commission to issue a robust proposal for a directive on the right to legal aid, for those who need it, in all circumstances in which the need for access to a lawyer has been recognised and guaranteed under the Directive. We hope that the forthcoming measure will include, as a minimum, standards relating to eligibility for legal aid, timely decisions, scope of legal aid, choice of lawyer and independence and quality of the lawyers providing legal aid.
