So we wanted the strong cash flow from hotels, entertainment and so on.&amp;rdquo; It is all a far cry from his youth, as a skinny 15-year-old in the PLA, when his basic training saw him march for two months, and 750 miles, through snow and ice. Mr Wang, whose father was a soldier before becoming a high-ranking government official, initially dreamed of being a general. Then, when the army was slimmed down in the 1990s, he was discharged and became a government official.

This might seem like no big deal - weren&apos;t they both huge action stars of the 1980s? Yes, but there the similarity ends. Schwarzenegger is essentially a comedian who specializes in cruelty. His whole appeal is that he&apos;s impervious. He exists in a universe in which nothing can hurt him. In fact, half the fun of a Schwarzenegger movie is watching others catch on to his invincibility, usually a few seconds too late.
