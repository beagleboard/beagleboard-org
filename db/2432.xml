But he gave few details of the array of restructuring talks going on from New York to Rio. In New York, holders of $3.6 billion of bonds in his oil company OGXânow valued at pennies on the dollarâare trying to force him to put $1 billion more into the company. Meantime, Mr. Batista is asking bondholders to put their money into the company. He says they will likely take control of it. If they can&apos;t agree, the case could end up in Brazilian courts.
