    <body>What do you like doing in your spare time? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jim.ac.in/indep/#identify&quot;&gt;eriacta ranbaxy&lt;/a&gt;  As if you needed anyone to tell you, airline travel is expensive &amp;ndash; and it&apos;s getting more so. The average domestic airline ticket is currently $379, only up a dollar from 2012, but a $44 jump from the $335 average ticket price in 2009, according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Fortunately, even with the rising cost of jet fuel, some analysts believe airfares won&apos;t rise until the federal lawsuit designed to stop the proposed merger of American Airlines and US Airways is settled. (If American or US Airways raise prices, that may give the federal government more of an argument to stand in the way of the merger. It is concerned the merger will cut competition and lead to higher fares.)
