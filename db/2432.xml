    <body>I&apos;m interested in this position &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/clarkston-heights-pharmacy-clarkston-wa-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;clarkston heights pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;I believe that the problem is a game of two halves. In the first instance you have a 1:3 chance of getting the prize. Once you&amp;#039;ve made your initial choice, even though the &amp;#039;box&amp;#039; contents remain the same, one &amp;#039;false&amp;#039; choice is removed and you are then offered the chance to choose again. There is a play on words here, perhaps, with the option to &amp;#039;switch&amp;#039;. Effectively you are being asked to make a choice of 1:2. Now, if this is always going to happen then the odds of you winning the prize in the first instance is 1:2, as it doesn&amp;#039;t really matter whether or not you choose correctly the first time - one &amp;#039;false&amp;#039; is going to be removed and you&amp;#039;ll be presented with just two options. It&amp;#039;s mind trickery. The first choice is totally irrelevant because you will always end up having to pick one option from two in order to attain the prize. In my humble opinion.&quot;
