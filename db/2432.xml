    <body>I have my own business &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/medishieldlifesg-0bae.pdf#downward&quot;&gt;wew.medishieldlife.sg&lt;/a&gt;  What the FCA proposes though does meet many of these concerns with a limit on times a loan can be rolled over â the lenders wanted a limit of three, debt charities one, the FCA decided on two â and also there is a curbing of the ability of lenders to automatically take money from borrowers&apos; accounts, something which can really send an individual&apos;s finances spiralling. There is also a pledge to monitor firms&apos; advertising and I think this is a crucial area where the FCA can really make a difference. We need an end to promises of quick decisions on loans and the idea that borrowing money can be a fun thing to do. These are only the first steps and they have taken too long, but I believe we are moving in the right direction over payday.
