    <body>I went to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/food4lesscom-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;1stclassdrugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;Was I? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, maybe,&amp;rdquo; shrugs the mellow environmentalist who is so off-the-grid that the only surfing he truly enjoys involves the world-beating waves that pound the shore near his home on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s main island. Still, he&amp;rsquo;s been online enough to have heard of one rumour. &amp;ldquo;There was one recently that was really funny &amp;ndash; everybody started texting and calling me,&amp;rdquo; he says, a smile splitting his craggily handsome features. &amp;ldquo;It was this crazy thing that came out on the internet &amp;ndash; a sex scandal! Somebody put out a press release saying &amp;lsquo;Jack Johnson nude photos released!&amp;rsquo; They said they&amp;rsquo;d found my camera and they were posting the pictures.&amp;rdquo; But the release was deliberately misleading: the photos were of nude statues. &amp;ldquo;It was just a dumb joke, but it was pretty funny,&amp;rdquo; he says.
