We fund approximately 30% of the UN. If the UN is useless then why have it? This is in Israel&amp;#8217;s back yard. They want to be a world power and have that state, what is Israel going to do about it? What are all the oil barons going to do with their profits? Are they going to help the refugees? Or, will the USA get pressured into spending all our tax dollars in perpetual war, so the oil barons can keep their assets in tact? What about China, don&amp;#8217;t they have a big army? Let China do the dirty work, they have built a nasty WAR machine, let them try it out.
