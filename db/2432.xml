    <body>Very interesting tale &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/prescriptionhealthstudiocom-a511.pdf&quot;&gt;chugai-pharm.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;  This research makes a very important point, and one which the Queen&amp;#039;s Nursing Institute has also been making. Unless there are strong community nursing teams, with good leadership and skill mix, it will not be possible to move patient care from hospitals into the community. Our report, &amp;#039;Nursing People at Home&amp;#039;, published in November, highlighted this. We are very concerned about the fall in district nurse numbers. With the pressures of an ageing population, many of whom have complex, long term conditions, the need for qualified district nurses will rise, not fall. Increased workloads on fewer nurses creates a vicious circle, as a third say they do not plan to be working as a district nurse within five years. Where will this leave patient care?
