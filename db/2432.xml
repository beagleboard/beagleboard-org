    <body>I&apos;d like to withdraw $100, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/venlafaxine-hcl-drug-bank-aaa8.pdf#anna&quot;&gt;get prescription effexor side effects&lt;/a&gt;  Cambodia&amp;#8217;s garment industry is huge and getting bigger. More than 300,000 workers produce the clothing, mostly for exports. There is a high chance you have worn clothing from Gap or H&amp;M that has been stitched together here. Demand and investments are surging. So, too, is labor unrest. That&amp;#8217;s no surprise. Although salaries and conditions for workers in Cambodia are not as bad as in Bangladesh (the monthly minimum wage of $80 compared to only $38 in Bangladesh; in China it is $150) protests and strikes quadrupled over the last year. There have already been 48 strikes this year, more than in the whole of 2010 and 2011 combined.
