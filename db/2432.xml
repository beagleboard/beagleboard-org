I wonder if the act of naming the condition has made matters almost worse. Now you have to accept that he isn&amp;rsquo;t going to change and that realisation brings a whole new set of emotions and worries. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I know very little about Asperger&amp;rsquo;s, so I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea how your partner would react if you went behind his back. Surely after 24 years of navigating his condition you have an idea of how best to proceed?

They argued the program violated the Fourth Amendment, squandered taxpayer money and made intelligence-collecting overbroad and therefore less effective.

Every type of media we have come to know have examples that could be easily labeled in the same way the author labeled this game. They tend to be accepted and those who do not accept need to not partake in exploring said media. Sadly&amp;#8230;people are incorrectly closing the gap between real and unreal. Games are a form of entertainment, one that is very immersive but is complete fiction none the less. As the world eagerly awaits the next episode of a myriad of television episodes&amp;#8230;.many of which are as morally inept as the Grand Theft Auto series, and they portray REAL people acting very immorally, they receive critical acclaim and much less criticism than this game has in it&amp;#039;s first week. Bottom line&amp;#8230;the game is FICTION, and marketed and restricted for an adult audience that know right from wrong. If kids get this game they have a lack of parental support. As for desensitivity&amp;#8230;.fiction and media are by no means the only way we become so, and if we knew everything that was going on in the real world&amp;#8230;.we would become even more desensitized. You know how this game works for me, a few days a week I get home from my full time job and plug in the game for a few hours, get some humor in, have fun and knock the edge off the stress. Then I get up the next day and keep doing the right thing for my family and community. Just my opinion.
