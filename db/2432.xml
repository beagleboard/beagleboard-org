    <body>Could you ask her to call me? &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/quantum-pharma-share-price-92e2.pdf&quot;&gt;quantum pharma share price chat&lt;/a&gt;  I cover real estate, writing about everything from trends in the housing market to ultra high-end luxury listings to data-based cities lists. Real estate is in my blood thanks to a realtor for a mom and a property developer/landlord for a dad. I have had a front row seat for the real estate market&apos;s inflation and subsequent crash over the past decade, watching my dad carry on with underwater mortgages and my mom struggle to put home sales together. I have been both a homeowner and a renter in the New York area and can&apos;t decide which I prefer.I am also a regular guest on the &apos;Forbes on Fox&apos; show on Fox News every Saturday morning and can sometimes be found discussing the major business headlines of the week on MSNBC&apos;s &apos;Weekends with Alex Witt.&apos;   Before taking on the real estate beat, I worked as an Anchor/Reporter in Forbes Video. These days I shoot videos of crazy homes.I graduated from New York University in 2009 with a BA in Anthropology and prior to that I worked in the other end of media as a recording artist with Sony.          If you have tips, story ideas or listings to submit for consideration, email me at mbrennan@forbes.com.
