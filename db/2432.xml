The Satellite Click has all its PC hardware built behind the screen, so it can be detached to work as a 13.3-inch touch tablet. The keyboard base has extra battery cells built in to give users around two more hours of extra runtime in addition to the extra utility from the keyboard and trackpad. When docked and plugged in, the battery behind the screen charges first, then the battery in the base. When away from AC power, the batteries discharge in reverse order, ensuring that the tablet portion of the system has the most available power. The Satellite Click uses an AMD A4 (Temash) processor with built-in AMD Radeon HD 8000 graphics, 4GB of system memory, and a 500GB hard drive. The Satellite Click will come with Windows 8 with an available update to Windows 8.1. The Satellite Click will be available from Best Buy and Toshiba&apos;s online store in September starting at $599.99.
