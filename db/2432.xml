    <body>I&apos;d like to speak to someone about a mortgage &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?lovastatin.viagra.filitra&quot;&gt;que es test x180&lt;/a&gt;  And yet most Brits don&apos;t realise this. I&apos;m always surprised at some of the reactions my British friends/ work mates/ contacts have when I explain I&apos;m married to a Russian. Some of them actually let out a laugh. Some are curious (how did we meet, etc). But mostly &amp;ndash; even in this cosmopolitan, multicultural city of London &amp;ndash; it surprises them. &quot;A Russian?&quot; they bark, one eyebrow raised. Then come the inevitable jokes: I must be filthy rich (my personal favourite, that my husband owns a diamond mine from which my engagement ring came), or we must be drowning in vodka every night or lastly, that Russians are dodgy. Part of the maffia. Part of the &apos;baddy&apos; crowd in movies. I usually laugh it all off &amp;ndash; after all, they&apos;re only joking &amp;ndash; but it does sometimes get a bit predictable, awkward &amp;ndash; well, boring, quite frankly.
