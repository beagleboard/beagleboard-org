    <body>I work for myself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?levitra.trecator-sc.ansaid&quot;&gt;truderma face wash&lt;/a&gt;  The essential problem confronting the company is that the stories selected have little dramatic potency and - no great match for the school&apos;s-out time of year - carry a thinly disguised didactic function. The Boy Who Cried Wolf! attempts to subvert this moral-of-the-tale preachiness by adopting a mock-solemnity that can tip into ridiculousness. As they saunter onto the stage, picturesquely adorned with trees, fake grass and an abundance of flowers, the cast, led by Chris Bianchi, Lucy Tuck and Tom Wainwright - with support from folksy musician-composers Benji and Will Bower - fix us with deadpan looks. The mood is bashful, whimsical, British, slightly knowing, slightly lackadaisical - but above all slight.
