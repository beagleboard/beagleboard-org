    <body>What company are you calling from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/safemeds4allcom-discount-code-a511.pdf&quot;&gt;safemeds4all.com reviews&lt;/a&gt;  When the Nexus 7 debuted last week, there wasn&apos;t any confusion as to which feature Google most wanted to emphasize: the display easily got the most lip service during the event. Last year&apos;s model had a perfectly acceptable 1,280 x 800 pixel IPS LCD panel, which was more than reasonable for a $200 tablet.

Not to worry, though, as the new Nexus 7 has an increased resolution of 1,920 x 1,200, which translates to a pixel density of 323 pixels per inch, up from a puny 216 ppi on the OG model.
