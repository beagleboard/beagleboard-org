Cortana is also expected to be open to developers so that they can integrate it with their apps which would be interesting, especially given that other voice assistants such as Siri remain closed to developers. In any case word has it that the feature is in the final testing phase so hopefully it will be done in time to ship with the Windows Phone 8.1 update.
