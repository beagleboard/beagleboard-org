Another period would be the years leading up to the Civil War and also a few decades after. It&apos;s hard for me to give you a tight answer because it really has been evolving.

And, of course, in the 1950s, Lyndon Johnson, as Democratic leader of the Senate, gave it an even tougher edge, and it gained more prerogatives for the floor leader. The Senate likes to think of itself as a body of equals. But LBJ certainly became the first among equals. If you look at the current majority leader, Harry Reid, he is certainly the first among equals in today&apos;s Senate. One of the things we tried to develop in the book was the sense of change over time in response to national challenges.
