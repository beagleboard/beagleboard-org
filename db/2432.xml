    <body>I&apos;m doing an internship &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/nadodostakimyasicom-bac9.pdf#acquisition&quot;&gt;buy-prescription-drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  There are no specific conditions associated with obesity but it is a risk factor for disease markers such as hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and elevated cholesterol. Obesity is directly linked with established diseases such as certain cancers, liver disease, atherosclerosis and diabetes. However, there is much discussion about how obesity contributes to disease and this picture is far from clear. It is well documented that being sedentary is a dangerous pastime, with fit fat people having less disease and outliving unfit lean people. Therefore &apos;fitness&apos; appears very protective. One emerging theory is that it is the upstream determinants of obesity not the obesity itself that is causing disease. The toxic combination of a sedentary life and the daily calorie overload required to support obesity act synergistically to overwhelm the organs and metabolic process that maintain homeostasis and health. If this is the case, then obesity cannot be a disease, it is merely a sign and symptom of our obesogenic environments, or as some would say, of our lifestyle choices.
