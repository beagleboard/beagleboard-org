Then, after the Jets recovered a muffed punt at the Jagsâ 3 late in the second quarter, Sanchez couldnât get them any points, taking too long to throw away a third-down pass as the clock expired, ending the half.

If a secondary strike happens quickly, after others nearby had rushed to the scene, she said, one has to question how the government would know those people to be militants as well.
