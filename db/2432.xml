A 2012 survey of families with teen girls who said they didn&apos;t plan on having their daughters vaccinated found that 19% said their daughter didn&apos;t need the vaccine, 14% hadn&apos;t had the vaccine recommended to them by their doctor, 13% had safety concerns about the vaccine, 12% didn&apos;t have knowledge of the vaccine or the disease and 10% said their daughter wasn&apos;t sexually active.
