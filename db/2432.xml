By performing 750,000 safety inspections each year, ASIs ensure the airlines operate at the highest level of safety, on behalf of the traveling public, at training centers, hangers, airports, and aboard hundreds of revenue flights every day. Every day that is, until now. Congress has decided (thank you very much), that performing those 2,900 daily safety inspections, targeted at already identified air transportation risks with the sole purpose of keeping the traveling public safe, is no longer important. Think about that as you drive to the airport this week.
