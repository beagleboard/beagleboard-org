Swedish goalkeeper Johan Wiland, who made stunning saves during the Champions League opener against Juventus that ended 1-1, said &quot;we were too bad&quot; and lacked focus. Wiland said he was worried about playing at the Bernabeu. &quot;There is reason to be worried after such an effort. We must of course try to do our best,&quot; he said. Coach Stale Solbakken noted Madrid lost to Atletico, but he expected &quot;huge pressure.&quot; The biggest challenge for Copenhagen, Solbakken said, would be the change of pace and to try and play his team&amp;#39;s own style and not always have to go running after the ball. It is the first time Copenhagen meets Madrid.
