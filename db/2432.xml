    <body>What are the hours of work? &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/my-pharmbiz-6a83.pdf#eating&quot;&gt;pandamed.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;  According to payroll company ADP (automatic data processing, Inc.) â161,000 jobs were added in July and 159,000 jobs were added in august.â The numbers have been a disappointment since analysts across the board expected the job market to reach higher estimates. ADP notes that the âeconomy is growing too slowly to rapidly boost hiring.â Financial analysts from Deutsche bank forecasted a slowing of growth still positive in trajectory, but with a more meager slope, a 1.5 percent expansion to 2 percent. Two examples of details of the happenings inside the numbers show that construction firms have reportedly added 16,000 jobs, while financial services firms shed 4,000 jobs.
