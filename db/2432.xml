The court ruled Wednesday that he had been improperly tried in a federal court for a crime that should have been treated as a state offense. Prison officials were notified of the ruling on Thursday, and an official at the Jalisco state prosecutors&apos; office said the drug lord left prison before dawn on Friday. The official was not authorized to speak on the record.
