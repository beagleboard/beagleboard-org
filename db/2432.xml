As Griffin and his team towed &amp;ldquo;Namu&amp;rdquo; south in a floating pen, the rest of the whale&amp;rsquo;s pod, including his mother, followed behind. Young whales were taken because they were easier to manage. In Cowperthwaite&amp;rsquo;s film, men who took part in similar &amp;ldquo;kidnappings&amp;rdquo; weep on camera as they recall separating young whales from their families. Later, in an even more upsetting scene, an infant orca born at SeaWorld is taken from its mother, who then begins to make sounds never heard before. Analysed by experts, they were found to be long-distance calls: she was trying to reach her calf, now hundreds of miles away in another oceanarium.

Tom Cole, R-Okla., also said a shutdown was not in the GOP&apos;s interest, but said Republicans want to force action in the Senate on the health care law. &quot;We have some leverage there,&quot; he said. &quot;We have some Democratic vulnerabilities. We have a lot of Democrats who don&apos;t want to have to vote on this, and that frankly might want to work with us in some way to not have to face that choice, but we&apos;ll never know that if we can&apos;t get the vehicle over there to them to have a chance to deal with it.&quot;
