In 1991, the average high school graduate could expect to earn wages and benefits of $2.1 million (in today&apos;s dollars) over the course of a career. Contrast that with the average college graduate who could expect to earn $3.5 million, netting an additional $1.4 million. Jump ahead two full decades, and by 2011, the average high school graduate could expect to earn $1.7 million versus $3.4 million for the average college graduate &amp;ndash;Â an additional $1.7 million. In other words, going to college in 1991 would add $1.4 million to your earnings, but today, it adds $1.7 million. The travesty is that this $300,000 increase is not due to college degrees becoming more valuable. It is due to high school diplomas becoming less valuable. Both high school and college graduates are actually earning less now than they were a full generation ago.
