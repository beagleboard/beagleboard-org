Like its sister squadron at Eglin, it lacks the Block 2B software that would allow the planes to drop real bombs, engage enemy aircraft, or do much besides fly in good weather. Moreover, the planes at Yuma, like the entire fleet of F-35s, are hobbled by design flaws, some of which, according to General Bogdan, will require retrofitting.

Solar power remains an inefficient source of energy and is hugely expensive - installing 35 GW of solar capacity would cost around $50 billion, plus the subsidies needed for solar producers under long-term power purchase agreements with the government, analysts said.
