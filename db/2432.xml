Rumors have abounded since early 2012 about Valve working on some sort of super-secret piece of hardware that would finally unify the disparate worlds of PC and console gaming. In the process, the mysterious new device was made out to be the first serious competitor to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One&apos;s dominance of living room gaming.

The Vaseline Skin Fund promises to &apos;improve the well-being of people with skin disorders&amp;rsquo;. But the pitch on the fund&amp;rsquo;s website begins with a series of scary claims &amp;ndash; such as that &apos;a third of people with eczema feel people don&amp;rsquo;t want to touch them&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; closely followed by the brand push. That seems designed to shift product by lowering self-esteem rather than raising it. But Polman is convinced of his company&amp;rsquo;s virtue. &apos;The only difference between us and charitable NGOs is that we have figured out how to do it without begging money from anyone,&amp;rsquo; he told me.
