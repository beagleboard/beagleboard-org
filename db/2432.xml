The result may not look anything like that eye-popping 2009 season above, but if he can turn the clock back even just to 2011 he&amp;#8217;d earn his keep in Anaheim and give the Angels a far better chance of returning to contention next year than they would have had with a hobbled Pujols in the lineup for the remainder of this season and possibly the remainder of his contract.
