If your son marries, he can still get his green card through your petition. His wife, and his children will qualify to get residence also as his âderivativeâ beneficiaries. However, he and his family may all get residence more quickly if he marries after becoming a permanent resident. Iâll explain why, but the choice requires a careful review of his case. I suggest you consult an immigration law expert.

It says a lot about Austen&apos;s popularity and who she&apos;s popular with. It&apos;s not just middle-aged women.&quot;

Both of them are lower than at any point before women had finished their big move into the jobs market, and the Fed must surely take its &amp;#8220;full employment&amp;#8221; mandate to refer as much to this number as it does to the unemployment figures. (The unemployment statistics in general, and the headline unemployment rate in particular, are misleading mainly because they don&amp;#8217;t include discouraged workers who have given up looking for work.)
