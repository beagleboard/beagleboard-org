High-profile supporters such as writers Arthur Miller and William Styron rallied to prove his innocence.

His daughter has schizophrenia, and his wife committed suicide. His current girlfriend once promised the family they would care for Zhang, but it never happened. Yinxi&apos;s argument: they&apos;re not married, so they&apos;re not obligated.

Cell phone signals are much too weak to interfere with aircraft electronics. Cell phones were banned on airliners after 9/11 when the government announced that the passengers on flight 93 had called their families on their cell phones, something which is physically impossible. They didn&amp;#8217;t want the public to find out that cell phones don&amp;#8217;t work on airliners, at least those who did not already know.
