The blog is also a way for us to provide GlobalPost&amp;rsquo;s in-depth reporting and foundation-supported Special Reports &amp;mdash; on rights relating to labor, gender, sexuality, the environment, the Internet, children, speech and assembly, and more &amp;mdash; with steady updates, insights and analysis worth sharing. This is a blog called RIGHTS, but the story telling here about those rights are not intended as advocacy and will always stay true to GlobalPost&amp;rsquo;s reporting standards of fairness, accuracy and independence.

The most inflammatory parental response is a comparison to the perfect cousin or sibling, so clever that their results illuminate the entire extended family like a constellation of grade A*s shining in the night sky. This has been winding everyone up since nursery school. Also to be avoided are such morale-boosters as: &quot;Congratulations, you&amp;#039;ve nearly done as well as that eight-year-old in Hong Kong.&quot;
