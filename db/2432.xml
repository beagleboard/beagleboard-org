    <body>We used to work together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?spironolactone.misoprostol.ritonavir.cialis&quot;&gt;viagra precio farmacias del ahorro&lt;/a&gt;  But at a point where the iPhone has been polished to its logical conclusion and the world eagerly awaits the company&amp;#8217;s foray into some new category, Esslinger is more preoccupied with other design terrain. Now an instructor of Industrial Design at the Beijing DeTao Masters Academy in Shanghai, Esslinger says he implores his students to consider their work today in the context of tomorrow. &amp;#8220;Today is what&amp;#8217;s thought about long ago,&amp;#8221; he explained to me over the phone from Shanghai. &amp;#8220;Now today we have to we have to project, think, experiment, prototype the future.&amp;#8221; Esslinger still remembers a useful model posed to him by one of his instructors during his early days as a design student in Germany. &amp;#8220;He said, OK, the future is accelerating. We know that,&amp;#8221; Esslinger explains. &amp;#8220;But look back 40 to 50 years, and make a model of what happened from then until today. That&amp;#8217;s what compresses into the next 10 years. Then you know what to expect.&amp;#8221; And what exactly will we see a decade hence? Here are four areas Esslinger thinks are ripe for innovation.
