Gomez admired his first-inning homer too long and shouted at Braves starter Paul Maholm as he rounded the bases. Irate catcher Brian McCann blocked Gomezâs approach to home plate and players rushed out of their dugouts. In the fray, Brewers third baseman Aramis Ramirez aggravated a knee injury and was also out Thursday.
