    <body>How would you like the money? &lt;a href=&quot;https://newscvm.com/stmap_e9bb0.html?nevirapine.xalatan.levitra&quot;&gt;omeprazole cr 40mg cap&lt;/a&gt;  I do think there is a subtext of the author lamenting some of the costs (as he describes them in various forms) - I call that feeling sorry for himself. But as someone else punted out, and despite the NFL pushing the all ages, family thing apparently to some extent or the other, his situation is, I would argue, in the minority as far as game attendees goes. Again - my perception, admittedly. It&apos;s hard to cater to everyone, and less likely when many teams are enjoying good attendance. Maybe he should move to JAX? Wait - they just offered free beer to buy tix; on second thought that would be a bad idea.
