Scott McDonald, who was discharged in 2011 after 15 years in the Army, was initially given basic drugs, like ibuprofen, and then put on a seizure drug, gabapentin. He was later prescribed anti-depression and anxiety medications, including zoloft and valium, and finally a powerful narcotic, percocet, according to his widow.
