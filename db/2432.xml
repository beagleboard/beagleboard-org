    <body>Yes, I play the guitar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/proscar-5-mg-precio-9e88.pdf&quot;&gt;finasteride 5mg buy&lt;/a&gt;  Obama was a hawk in Libya but a mouse in Syria. In reality the U.S. even without NATO would be able to decimate Assad&amp;#8217;s forces in a full scale confrontation. Assad has lost country of half of his country and can barely keep the rebels at bay. I am not advocating foreign intervention but surely more can be done in a non-military manner to ease out Assad and stop him from killing more of his people to preserve his 43 year family rule. Interestingly enough, most of the &amp;#8220;non lethal aid&amp;#8221; promised to the rebels is still sitting on the shelves, not delivered.
