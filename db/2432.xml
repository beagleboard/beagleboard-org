    <body>Very funny pictures &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/cad-pharmacy-6865.pdf&quot;&gt;cad pharma&lt;/a&gt;  For the first five innings, as the Captain got a workout on his endangered ankle, beating out a slow hopper to third base in the first inning, and grounding out in the second and fifth, his mere presence in the Yankee lineup seemed to serve as an inspiration to his mates â a lot of whom were not so familiar to him â as they battled back from deficits of 3-1 and 4-3 with a four-run salvo in the fifth off struggling Royals righthander Ervin Santana. Their final run would come in the sixth, with Jeter being the beneficiary of the RBI, but it was a most uncharacteristic one for him â a ground ball to short, with runners at second and third, on which he pulled up three-quarters the way down the line and loped the rest of the way to first base.
