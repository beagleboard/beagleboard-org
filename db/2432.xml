    <body>In tens, please (ten pound notes) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/ingleside-pharmacy-fax-number-e0f9.pdf&quot;&gt;ingleside pharmacy robbed&lt;/a&gt;  If these idiots shut down the government I think Obama should issue an executive order to the Secretary of the Treasury to stop all pay checks to Congress (Congressman, aides, janitors any one who works in either House). Shut down the utilities to both houses and withhold funds they normally receive to run their offices. Keep it that way until they jointly pass a bill funding the government. They can meet at a Morel 6 (Jeff will keep the light on for ya) to resolve their differences. They are the ones creating this mess. They should be the first ones to experience the consequences.
