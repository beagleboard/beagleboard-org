Exceptionally strong ensemble casts can, in any case, triumph over flawed material, and this is why I think the production managed to keep me hooked until the very end.

Emanuel failed to win pension concessions from the city&apos;s police sergeants union earlier this year, and the Democrat-controlled legislature, which has been unable to come up with a plan for the state&apos;s own huge pension funding problem, has made no known progress on relief for Chicago.
