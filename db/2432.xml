Repeated studies since have shown no connection, the paper was eventually rejected by the journal that published it and Britain&apos;s top medical board stripped Wakefield of the right to practice medicine.

By analyzing the signal&apos;s spectrum, the researchers can build images of the cellular makeup of the tissue.

The structure and texture of these fragments indicate they were formed by a very intensive melting process, due to collision or close proximity to the sun. The researchers explained this material is very distinct from the âfusion crustâ â a thin layer of material on the surface of the meteorite that melts and solidifies as it barrels through our atmosphere.
