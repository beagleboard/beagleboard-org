That would be good news for Germany, Europe&apos;s largest economy, which sends some 40 percent of its exports to the single currency bloc.

You never know what&apos;s going to happen. I&apos;m just going to have fun on the golf course. When I finish here, I&apos;ll have a glass of red wine later on. I&apos;m just going to keep doing the same thing.&quot;

Mallett had his moments in the preseason but overall was inconsistent in completing just 55.3 percent of passes for three touchdowns and an interception. The team obviously has some confidence in Mallett, but of course, if Tom Brady goes down, the season is likely toast, no matter if Mallett, Tebow, or an alien is the backup. Might as well use that roster spot on a special teams contributor rather than a No. 3 quarterback, I guess, even though I think Tebow provides some value as a change-of-pace guy.
