    <body>What do you do? &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/pharmed-group-corporation-6a83.pdf#astonishing&quot;&gt;pharmed group corporation&lt;/a&gt;  This state judge is our of her jurisdiction. In fact, she has NO jurisdiction in this matter. Once the bankruptcy petition was filed, ALL jurisdiction concerning the assets and liabilities of the City of Detroit transferred to Judge Rhodes, the Bankruptcy Judge assigned to this matter. Judge Aquilina is acting without any authority whatsoever in this matter. In addition, section 362 of the bankruptcy law prevents ANYONE, including any state judge, from taking any action at all concerning Detroit&amp;#8217;s assets and liabilities. I have been practicing bankruptcy law for about 30 years and have seen many judges get their hands slapped for violating the bankruptcy laws. If judge Aquilina keeps this up, it is not going to go well with her.
