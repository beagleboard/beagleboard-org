    <body>Do you know what extension he&apos;s on? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?diskus.misoprostol.cialis.amaryl&quot;&gt;comprar viagra espaa barata&lt;/a&gt;  Trading exchanges. Think about NASDAQ. Should there be a NASDAQ of Bitcoin? Should there be hedge funds of Bitcoin? Should people short sell Bitcoin? Should people be able to market make in Bitcoin? The whole âBitcoin as an investment assetâ I think is quite interesting. I also think allowing more merchants to accept Bitcoin and instantly convert it into whatever local currency they want so theyâre just allowing people to pay them the way they want to pay them but not have to accept the risk of holding Bitcoin. I think there are a lot of interesting opportunities there. I do think more and more people will accept Bitcoin. There are all sorts of geeky type of activities but Word Press accepts Bitcoin, Reddit accepts Bitcoin, 4chan accepts Bitcoin.
