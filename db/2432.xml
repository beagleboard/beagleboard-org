    <body>When do you want me to start? &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/cialis-buy-online-canada-a511.pdf&quot;&gt;is ordering cialis from canada safe&lt;/a&gt;  In this case, the Vixia has a lens along one of the edges of the camera, can be propped up via a stand, and you can watch the action on the tilting LCD screen from either in front of the lens or behind it. The camcorder has a 12.8-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor. The lens has a fixed f/2.8 aperture, and while it&amp;#39;s capable of filming/taking photos in both a wide and close-up mode, it seems the latter is just a crop of the former, rather than an actual zoom. For video, the Vixia has the equivalent of 16.8mm at 8.99-megapixels in wide mode, and 35mm at 2.07-megapixels in close-up. For still images, it&amp;#39;s 15.4mm at 12MP, and 32.1mm at 2.76MP, respectively. That&amp;#39;s a 160-degree, field of view in video mode, which should be enough for even the most wide of fisheye enthusiasts.
