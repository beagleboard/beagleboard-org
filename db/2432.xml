    <body>How much is a First Class stamp? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?fildena.levitra.amiloride&quot;&gt;ions pharma&lt;/a&gt;  LLCD is a 65 pound system made up of an optical module, a modem module and a controller electronics module.   A 10 centimeter wide telescope onboard the satellite will point a 0.5-watt infrared laser &amp;ndash; the same type used in ground-based fiber optic cables -- at one of three receiving stations on earth, where the now 5 kilometer wide beam (yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a LOT of spread) will be picked up by a cluster of four 17 inch telescopes used to collect and focus the signals into optical fiber and detectors. A cluster of four 6 inch telescopes are used to send a beacon to the satellite for pointing, as well as uplink data.
