What is the LRP, you ask? The LRP is the &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; strategy all Communist nations signed onto in 1960 to defeat the West with. The last major disinformation operation under the LRP was the &amp;#8220;collapse&amp;#8221; of the USSR in 1991. The next major disinformation operation under the LRP will be the fraudulent collapse of the Chinese Communist government. When that occurs, Taiwan will be stymied from not joining the mainland.

Most memoirs contain moments of insight but Jones exchanges reflection for the hurling of blame. She blames the death of her grandfather, killed in a road accident, for preventing her from getting off with the boy who then went out with her best friend; she blames her dysfunctional relationship with men on a French &amp;ldquo;kitchen hand with dirty feet&amp;rdquo; who tried to take her virginity on a skiing trip but didn&amp;rsquo;t know about foreplay.

Linda is a &quot;determining factor about the Mormon religion&quot;? I think the phrase &quot;determining factor&quot; does not mean what you think it means. A determining factor is not a person or thing that decides if something is good or bad.
