    <body>Is it convenient to talk at the moment? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/aetnamedicarecomfindpharmacy2016-75b3.pdf#cardboard&quot;&gt;aetnamedicare.com 2017&lt;/a&gt;  The calls for greater punishment for diving are growing after Ashley Young&amp;#039;s yellow card against Crystal Palace. It is, however, a notoriously difficult offence for a referee to call instantly and correctly in the high tempo of a match unless it is an open-and-shut case, as with Young. There may be a stronger case for inflicting increased retrospective punishment on the offender when it is an obvious dive, as Young&amp;#039;s was. The player involved has history - Young was taken to task by his former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson for a similar incident in 2012, and he can have no complaints should he be hit with a suspension.
