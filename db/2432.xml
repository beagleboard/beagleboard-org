Technology has given anonymity to trolls and hecklers, allowing them to post not only hateful and racist or sexist messages to the world, but to threaten people as well. And it is worse, especially for young people. Children who were being teased or bullied at school at least got a break when they came home. Now, the abuse is 24/7.

Only about one in 10,000 of all the stars in the Milky Way reach that kind of mass.&quot;
