This is precisely what happened in Israel, which has used IPV since 2005. In August, the government launched a nationwide campaign to vaccinate all children under nine years of age with OPV. Unabated, the virus has been traveling across the country and was recently detected in the West Bank and Gaza, threatening neighboring countries. The vaccination campaign, which has already reached 50 percent of its target population, is critical to preventing further spread.
