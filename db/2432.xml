In investing, you&apos;re appealing to people&apos;s desire to have a lot more next year, 10 years from now or in 20 years. In philanthropy, you&apos;re appealing to a different side of their nature. You&apos;re trying to convince people who have been fortunate in life that there are an awful lot of people that did not get the long straw. After you&apos;ve taken care of yourself in a very good way and your family and all that, a lot of people can benefit if you apply some of those excess funds intelligently in education, in medicine, all kinds of things. It&apos;s a different appeal. And people respond differently to them, too. Q: When the day comes - say, maybe 50 years from now - when you become chairman of Berkshire, Howard, how do you think your very different life experiences from your father&apos;s will affect the company?
