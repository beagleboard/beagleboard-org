    <body>very best job &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/havana-club-anejo-blanco-1l-cena-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;kopa kavana&lt;/a&gt;  A shotgun is not an assault weapon, even though there is no such thing anyways. That did not keep this guy from killing 12 people with a firearm that only holds &quot;five&quot; shells. That is not high capacity, which again proves that capacity of a firearm means nothing. You have to insert new shells one at a time, and yet, no one could stop him while he did it. Just as limiting an AR-15 to 15 rounds would do nothing against a person motivated to kill as many people as they could.
