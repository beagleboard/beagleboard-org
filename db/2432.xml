    <body>I&apos;ve got a part-time job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlam.com/index.php/stmap_77410.html?rebetol.mexitil.cialis&quot;&gt;al haqq pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  As for battery life, we have something to celebrate: on an HSPA  network, the 3,300mAh battery easily gave us enough juice for a day of heavy use. After 10.5 hours of calls, camerawork, gaming and lots of WiFi downloads, we still had 27 percent remaining. On a day of light use, with just a few calls and a bit of gaming, and with no charging overnight, the phone still had 14 percent of battery after 40 hours of use. This was partly helped by the default Power Saver setting kicking in when the battery indicator turns yellow -- this feature clocks down the CPU, reduces screen brightness, turns off vibration feedback and turns off the data connection while the screen is off. Add the 1,200mAh battery cover (shown above) and you should easily make it through two days without issue, provided you can stand lugging the thing around for that long.
