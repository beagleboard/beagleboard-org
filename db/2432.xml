It was the last thing I had left on my list to do,&quot; said Eaton, who rallied after a relatively sub-par first half of the two-day competition. &quot;Now I&apos;ve done everything there is to do in multi-events.&quot;

He announced a fight against the &amp;#8220;four forms of decadence&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance. The party leadership may be priming itself for a purge &amp;#8212; locating local and midlevel officials that are low-hanging fruit: people they can make a public example of without impacting the top of the pyramid.

(China&amp;#8217;s foreign minister just traded in his Audi for the same domestic model that Mao used to drive around in.) Make no mistake &amp;#8212; these actions are largely cosmetic. They mitigate public dissent in the short-term, but they donât get at the root of the problem. Why is that? Chinaâs leaders canât fundamentally go after the problem because the problem is them.
