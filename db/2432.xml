The comet reaches what is known as the H2O turn on point. It begins to heat up. Subsurface ice melts and the pressure forces the material out through cracks or vents on the surface of the comet. Jets of this material spew out into space like geysers (remember the scene in the movie Armageddon?). This process is called outgassing. These jets can not only affect the rotation (tumbling) of the comet, but also they can affect the comet&amp;rsquo;s orbital path through space.

But it was the exact opposite.&amp;rdquo; Her voice gets even quieter. &amp;ldquo;I guess it was good that it got noticed because I got so many people messaging me, more boys than girls actually, who have had the same experience. It really helped me and I think it helped them too.&amp;rdquo; The silver rings on her fingers glint in the sunlight. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think of sex the same way,&amp;rdquo; she says bluntly. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t. I wanted to kill myself. I felt violated, you know?&amp;rdquo;
