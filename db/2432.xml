At one point, tears sprang to his eyes when he talked about his early career and how he knew, even if he didnât make the major leagues, he still had his family. He was even revealing, as always, when he was honest about how much his mistake pitches haunted him, even as the pomp swirled and he was peppered with questions about Rivera. But, after all, Pettitte dealt with plenty of unusual moments Sunday, even for a place with such daily chaos as Yankeeland.
