Heâs someone you have to tell to slow down, you never have to tell him to speed up. Heâs off to an outstanding start and, like I said, I really believe the guy is going to contribute early.â

But Assad was in a box, too. He didn&apos;t want to get bombed. He threatened retaliation if he was bombed &amp;ndash; and didn&apos;t really have much to back that up. But politically, he couldn&apos;t be viewed as giving in to Obama or to Secretary of State John Kerry. His only face-saving measure was to deal with someone like Putin &amp;ndash; an &quot;imperfect messenger,&quot; to borrow a phrase from Anthony Weiner. But Putin was probably the only person who could deliver it.

It strikes me, too, that we have now held motorsport events at Goodwood in the &amp;ldquo;modern era&amp;rdquo; for a longer period than we hosted racing here originally between 1948 and 1966. Now that really is something that I simply could not have imagined way back in the early Nineties.
