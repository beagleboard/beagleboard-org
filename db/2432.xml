    <body>Could I make an appointment to see ? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?donepezil.viagra.zantac.glyburide&quot;&gt;healthcamps.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;  There is no reason to believe a private equity firm would run HP any better than Whitman, as they are cut from the same cloth. They need a product person, someone who understands technology, how it is implemented and used, and Whitman is not that person. You can&amp;#8217;t cost cut and PR your way into leading edge technology, and that&amp;#8217;s what Whitman brings to HP and the board is too clueless to recognize that. They think they need a steward of HP&amp;#8217;s IP (an asset with rapidly declining value) and brand name (not much different), and that&amp;#8217;s what they have and that&amp;#8217;s why they&amp;#8217;re shrinking.
