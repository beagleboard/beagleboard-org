    <body>Gloomy tales &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/no2-power-blast-customer-care-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;no2 power blast canada&lt;/a&gt;  Have you ever wondered why it says nowhere in the koran or by muhammed that muslim women should wear burqas? Its only in the last 25 to 30 years that it has become common. Its because they do not want to assimilate or integrate. Ask any muslim cleric. They do not want to associate with infidels. Its a fact. Therefor harsh as it sounds there will come a day in the future where for the world to survive as non islam we will have to abolish mosqes and ban islam. The koran is a book of war. Anyone trying to compare muhammed with Jesus is mentally ill. Jesus preached peace and love. Muhammed was in 26 battles and personally beheaded 25 Jews. I fail to see the comparison.
