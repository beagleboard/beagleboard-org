Bug repellent should not be the first line of defense against critters, since these products can carry risks for the environment as well as your health. However, for people living in regions where ticks and mosquitoes are plentiful, it&amp;#8217;s important to use repellents as part of your protection against diseases like Lyme and West Nile Virus. Wearing light covered clothing with sleeves and collars can also keep bugs away. And tucking pants into socks when walking through tall grass can create another barrier against ticks who hitch a ride and embark on a search for skin.Â Around the house, experts recommend draining areas with sitting water, keeping lawns mowed and regularly clearing brush to clear out infestations of mosquitoes and ticks.
