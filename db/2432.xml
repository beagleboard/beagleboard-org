Time after time, the voters&amp;rsquo; attitude is simple: unconditional praise. No matter how bad the health service&amp;rsquo;s performance, there is a feeling that it is safest in the hands of the party that created it. Apart from a short period in the run-up to the 2010 election, Labour has comfortably outstripped other parties on the issue in the polls, to the extent that it currently enjoys a 30-point lead. The NHS is such an electoral asset that Ed Miliband is expected to make it a central part of his campaign to be Prime Minister &amp;ndash; not least because he lags so badly on so many other issues, such as economic competence and personal credibility.
