    <body>About a year &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelifesinsurancequotes.com/aviation-medical-examiner-memphis-tn-6f97.pdf#waist&quot;&gt;aviation medical examiner salary uk&lt;/a&gt;  In addition, we continue to expand our digital marketing capabilities to drive subscription sales, including several successful Facebook and Google customer campaigns. As a testament to the appeal of those products to a wide variety of customers, we&apos;ve added about 6,000 new digital-only subscribers as a result of the rollout of our college digital subscription program earlier this year. The very first schools we approached about this opportunity, Florida State University in Tallahassee and the University of Cincinnati, are now providing digital subscriptions to their students and faculty. As a result, we now have 65,000 digital-only subscribers. And even more significantly, 1.3 million subscribers, or nearly half of our total customer base, have now activated their digital access. This is a key takeaway for us as it further corroborates our earlier projections.
