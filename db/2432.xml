He was 44. Police do not suspect foul play, The Salt Lake City Tribune reported. Dr. Drew Pinsky, the producer of VH1&apos;s &apos;Celebrity Rehab&apos; who oversaw Starr&apos;s treatment for heroin addiction in 2009, took to Twitter to mourn his former patient&apos;s death. &apos;Devastating to hear of Mike Starr succumbing to his illness,&apos; he tweeted. &apos;So very sad.
