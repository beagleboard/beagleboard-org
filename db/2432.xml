    <body>Will I have to work shifts? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/stmap_58840.html?benfotiamine.cialis.provera&quot;&gt;texas superfood commercial radio&lt;/a&gt;  And that nostalgic scenario was not entirely dissimilar to what I found once I arrived in Reykjavik proper. It may be Iceland&amp;rsquo;s capital city, but it still has a distinctly villagey feel. Not surprising, really, when you consider that it has a fairly minuscule population of about 120,000 (the population of the whole of Iceland is only about 320,000, spread over a land mass of 40,000 square miles, making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe). But this has not prevented Reykjavik developing into a quite outstanding cultural hub, with not only galleries, theatres, museums and public gardens to satisfy the most avid of culture vultures, but 40 annual festivals and events.
