There&amp;rsquo;s also the reappearance of positive &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; yields, which are calculated by subtracting the annual rate of inflation from the yield on bonds &amp;mdash; say, 10-year Treasuries. The math is straightforward: inflation rates in the U.S. over the next few years are expected to be in the neighborhood of 2 percent, not coincidentally right where the Fed wants them to be, while 10-year Treasury yields are up sharply to about 2.5 percent lately.

Those memories, in part, explained Furyk&apos;s wry assessment of his fast start at Oak Hill, particularly since he was putting better than he had in a while.
