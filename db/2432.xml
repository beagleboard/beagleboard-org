    <body>Have you seen any good films recently? &lt;a href=&quot;http://starbizzcon.com/stmap_45db0.html?tacrolimus.pletal.furosemide.cialis&quot;&gt;national pharmacy recruiters&lt;/a&gt;  Soriano has a no-trade clause in his contract, but he was expected to waive it for a deal to New York. The Cubs would likely pick up a majority of the $24 million still owed to Soriano through next season, with most of it going toward his $18 million salary for 2014. Because a large amount of money is being exchanged, the deal will have to be approved by the Commissioner&apos;s office.
