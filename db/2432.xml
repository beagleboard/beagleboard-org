Reported figures showed pre-tax profits down to £14.9m from £23.7m at the same stage last year. But the latter figure includes gains of £8.3m on the value of property, compared with a £1.4m fall in the first six months.

Timberlakeâs songs kept referring to the â70s work of Marvin Gaye and the 80sâ hits of Michael Jackson.
