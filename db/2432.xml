The defense put forth evidence in an attempt to create the doubt that was already present in the case, including a forensic expert to show the shooting was consistent with Zimmerman&apos;s version of events.

Customers looking at free-range chickens on the Benlai Shenghuo website, a 2012 start-up whose name roughly translates as &apos;original life&apos;, get details on the breed they are selecting and its diet, along with photos of the birds wandering on farms.

The average temperature in June in Barrow in the northern tip of the state was 39 Fahrenheit (4 Celsius), the highest on record, and that city had its warmest-ever combined June and July temperatures, according to the weather service.

According to the Government Accountability Office (G.A.O.), which is relatively independent, the price tag for each F-35 was supposed to be $81 million when the program began in October 2001. Since that time, the price per plane has basically doubled, to $161 million. Full-rate production of the F-35, which was supposed to start in 2012, will not start until 2019. The Joint Program Office, which oversees the project, disagrees with the G.A.O.âs assessment, arguing that it does not break out the F-35 by variant and does not take into account what they contend is a learning curve that will drive prices down over time. They say a more realistic figure is $120 million a copy, which will go down with each production batch. Critics, like Winslow Wheeler, from the Project on Government Oversight and a longtime G.A.O. official, argue the opposite: âThe true cost of the airplaneâwhen you cast aside all the bullshitâis $219 million or more a copy, and that number is likely to go up.â
