    <body>What do you want to do when you&apos;ve finished? &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/stmap_69bc0.html?viagra.pristiq.tylenol.paracetamol&quot;&gt;healthinter.org&lt;/a&gt;  T.J. Gentle, chief executive officer of Smart Furniture, an online custom furniture maker in Chattanooga, employs 250Â people, has seen sales grow 25Â percent this year, and was planning another round of hiringâuntil Republican hard-liners forced the federal government to close on Oct.Â 1. Gentle is the embodiment of moderate, business-minded pragmatism: He voted for President Obama and Tennesseeâs Republican Senator Bob Corker, splits his donations between the parties, and prefers divided government as a check on partisan excess. Like his plan to hire more workers, this too may change as a result of the shutdown. âItâs as if House Republicans are playing suicide bomber with the U.S. economy,â he says. âAs a businessman, it defies all reason and logic.â
