    <body>What&apos;s the last date I can post this to  to arrive in time for Christmas? &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/talking-medscom-e52c.pdf&quot;&gt;naturalhealthportal.md-hq.com&lt;/a&gt;  Experts at other big-name hospitals whose CU ratings fellshort of their reputations also questioned the methodology. &quot;Theaccuracy of claims data,&quot; like that CU used, &quot;is very low orunknown,&quot; said Dr Peter Provonost of Hopkins.

They still don&amp;#8217;t have the leadership including a fresh Board of Directors to move ahead instead of wallowing in their failure and missed opportunities. The creativity needed is already in place i.e. it e employees who are undervalued, mismanaged and blamed for the failures of the leadership and Board. Morale is so low it can crawl under the belly of an ant. It&amp;#8217;s time to reinvigorate and empower employees creating new products that will light a fire under what once was one of the finest and most creative companies in the world. The choice of Meg Whitman was not a wise one but what can be expected of a an ossified Board that lacks imagination and apparently also lacks business acumen. That is a double headed disaster that require urgent action but by whom? Shareholders are disempowered and there is nothing to stop the coming slide except, dare it be said, bankruptcy. What a shame to run this magical corporation into the ground.

There were certainly a lot of columns and blogs written about how the pornification of a &amp;ldquo;family show&amp;rdquo; was sending the wrong signal to children and teenagers, how she had debased and degraded herself, how she looked and acted like a &amp;ldquo;slut&amp;rdquo;. That word again.

We&amp;rsquo;ve seen confused players. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen an immobile quarterback playing behind a bad offensive line, in an offense designed to throw the ball downfield. It&amp;rsquo;s not the right mix.

Rabbis intone: We ask forgiveness of people weâve wronged before we seek it from on high.
