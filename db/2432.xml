    <body>I&apos;m in a band &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/stmap_e52c0.html?protonix.levitra.levofloxacin&quot;&gt;amitriptyline 10mg for nerve pain side effects&lt;/a&gt;  On the front, the bezels surrounding the display are noticeably narrower -- ASUS shaved off about 2.75mm on each side -- but on the top and bottom they&apos;re as wide as they ever were. According to the two companies, the idea is to ensure most users will have a place to hold the Nexus while using it in landscape mode (this is especially handy for games, we&apos;ve noticed). Since those bezels have remained the same size even as the tablet has gotten narrower, the front looks a little awkward proportionally speaking, given the screen&apos;s 16:10 aspect ratio. We suspect the top and bottom bezels could have been trimmed a bit too, and it wouldn&apos;t actually have had much of an effect on the user experience.
