    <body>Have you read any good books lately? &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/befar-cream-australia-3c8d.pdf&quot;&gt;befar cream australia&lt;/a&gt;  From January to June, the total number of foreign visitors, including business travelers and residents, entering China declined by 5 percent to just under 13 million compared with the same period last year, according to the China National Tourism Administration.

And Jonathan thanks for the detail on the guidance. Thatâs really helpful. But I guess my question is probably for Pat or Carl, I mean, you have a lot going on at VMware and you went through a lot of it on the call, but vSphere, your core virtualization market product is still the majority of your business today. I realize itâs less so as time goes on, but if you had to characterize where you were in the x86 compute capacity that still need to be virtualized. Where might that be? I mean, there is a lot of talk that 70% to 75% of x86 workloads have been virtualized. And I think you come up with the numbers similar to that, but you donât get paid based on the number of workloads that gets virtualized, you get paid based on the number of CPUs that gets virtualized or the number of â the amount of compute capacity. And I guess even roughly where that might be relative to that 70% to 75%?
