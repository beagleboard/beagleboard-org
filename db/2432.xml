    <body>Special Delivery &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?sulfasalazine.levitra.amaryl&quot;&gt;docosanol uk&lt;/a&gt;  I have always referred to the second week of the Seoul Olympics as my lost Olympic week. I do not remember anything that happened. I continued to cover the athletics but in reality the story of the Games had moved to Toronto where Johnson returned home. Pictures of Johnson washing his Ferrari Testarossa car with the license plate 9.83 for his world-record time set in Rome were what the world&amp;#8217;s media were publishing on their front pages, not the competition at the Olympics.
