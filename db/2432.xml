There are also fines for violations that wonât make consumers ill, such as posting permits in the wrong place or having too large a cart. The fines can run up to $500.

Theyâre standard in 89 percent of 2012 models, but are far less common among big pickups than other vehicle types, which could help explain why they account for six out of the 10 most stolen rides. On the other hand, the 2010-2012 Ford F-250 was in fact equipped with an immobilizer, so thieves are perhaps becoming smarter than the technology thatâs in place to stop them. Another explanation is that trucks suffer more claims for equipment theft from an open pickup bed than do SUVs and other models with enclosed cargo areas.
