Only a handful of hydrogen filling stations exist in the U.S. &quot;What we have is a chicken and egg problem,&quot; says Chris Hostetter, the group VP for strategic planning at Toyota Motor Sales USA. &quot;The entrepreneurs don&apos;t want to invest in hydrogen stations until there are enough cars on the road, and the carmakers can&apos;t sell large numbers of the car unless there&apos;s a place to fuel them.&quot;
