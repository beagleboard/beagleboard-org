    <body>Until August &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/neighborcare-pharmacy-portsmouth-va-7684.pdf&quot;&gt;neighborcare pharmacy portsmouth va&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;The Act of Killing&quot; delves into a peculiar aspect of contemporary Indonesian society in which the heads of death squads are still celebrated as national heroes. The state-sanctioned killers were led by the likes of Anwar, who rose from petty criminal to his current status as a self-confessed mass murderer proud of personally taking the lives of hundreds. After a 1965 coup that took down the existing government, assassin teams proliferated to wipe out the new enemies of the state: alleged communists and their sympathizers. The hit squads&apos; brutal purge accumulated into a full-fledged genocide, leaving an estimated 500,000 up to 1 million dead across Indonesia (backed in part by Western governments).
