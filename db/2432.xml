    <body>Wonderfull great site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/stmap_0bae0.html?penisole.metoprolol.cialis&quot;&gt;rogaine generic versions&lt;/a&gt;  Thank you Carl. Weâre very pleased with our Q3 results meeting or exceeding all of our key goals for the quarter. Weâre executing the plan we have shared with you and the year continues to play out as we expected. Q3 total reported revenue growth of 14% year-over-year was above the midpoint of our guidance range. License revenues of $564 million were up 15% year-over-year and exceeded the upper end of our guidance. Excluding pivotal and all divestitures total revenues grew 19% year-over-year in Q3 accelerating from 15% in Q2 and 13% in Q1, license revenue growth accelerated to 17% year-over-year up from 5% in Q2 and 1% in Q1. Overall services revenue grew 13% year-over-year excluding pivotal and all divestitures services revenue grew 20% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and profitability. Unless otherwise noted, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis and are reconciled to our gap results in the press release tables and posted on our investor relations website.
