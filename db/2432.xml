    <body>Could you please repeat that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/fluoxetinebuyonlinemedsbiz-5553.pdf#banged&quot;&gt;bpills.tk&lt;/a&gt;  But if the service is something you can watch on a web page, you have another option, whether the service has enabled the &quot;cast&quot; button or not. Any web page that you can view as a tab on Google&apos;s Chrome web browser can be sent to the Chromecast for viewing on the TV. Patel said that there&apos;s a problem with QuickTime video on web pages -- Chromecast picks up the video just fine, but the audio continues to play from your computer instead of from the TV. Google will no doubt try to address this, but probably won&apos;t get much help from QuickTime, which is owned by Google&apos;s arch-rival, Apple. Apple has its own TV receiver and has long been rumored to be developing some sort of more-advanced, game-changing TV device.
