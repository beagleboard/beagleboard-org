It passed the orbit of the farthest planet Neptune on August 25, 1989 (at the time, due to its highly elliptical orbit, the then-planet Pluto was closer to the Sun than Neptune). Its twin spacecraft, Voyager 2, actually flew close to the planet itself. In 1990, with their planetary missions accomplished, both Voyager missions were renamed the Voyager Interstellar Mission. This consists of three phases: detection of the termination shock (the edge of the Sunâs magnetic influence, where the solar wind slows); exploration of the heliopause (the interface between the solar wind and the interstellar wind); and exploration of interstellar space (the region where the interstellar wind dominates). In December 2004, Voyager crossed the termination shock. Roughly ten years later, the craft was expected to transverse the heliopause, which many consider the edge of the Solar System.
