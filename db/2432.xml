Skaggs then walked two to load the bases, but reliever Will Harris prevented further damage by getting Van Slyke to hit into an inning-ending double play.

After that, cut it to the ground and new basal leaves will come back. Other long flowerers are Campanula portenschlagiana &apos;Resholdt&amp;rsquo;s Variety&amp;rsquo;, a ground cover that flowers on and off from spring to autumn.
