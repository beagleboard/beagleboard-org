Itâs even tougher to know players in another teamâs locker room, especially when they play another sport. Packers QB Aaron Rodgers had been public in his defense of his friend, Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, against PED allegations and felt betrayed when Braun accepted his 65-game suspension last week. He said Braun had looked him in the eye and denied PED use. âIt doesnât feel great being lied to like that, and Iâm disappointed about the way it all went down,â Rodgers said.

It really doesnât make sense to me right now. People say, âOh, but itâs the neck.â But I feel like Iâm fine. Iâm willing to go out there and sacrifice and play with my team. This is what I love. Thatâs my choice.â
