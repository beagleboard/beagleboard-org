Since the original album clocks in at not much over 40 minutes, the show almost had to be padded. To accomplish that, Lauper talked â or rather, âtawkedâ â as much as she sang, leaning her into her deepest Noo Yawk accent. Segments of her speech illuminated the songs, as they were meant to. But many of her monologues rambled for minutes on end.
