However, the &quot;Girls Next Door&quot; star defended her choice. &quot;There are a lot of smug haters out there who bag on my choice of a name, but I don&apos;t care about what they think,&quot; she wrote on her blog. &quot;There was a girl in my school a few years younger than me named Rainbow and I was so envious of her name because it was so pretty and unusual. She was a perfectly normal, well-adjusted, sporty girl, by the way, so I&apos;m not worried about my daughter being &apos;traumatized&apos; by having an unusual name. ... I want my daughter to be proud of who she is and learn to speak up and stand up for herself at a young age.

What I&apos;ve noticed in the first few scripts this season is how this world is psychologically changing these people. I never thought they would start the season the way they started it. And that&apos;s as much as I can say.

Hunt is gorgeous, charismatic, fond of booze and drugs and women, and recklessly drawn to the mortal nature of his chosen sport. Lauda, by contrast, is precise and aloof, with prominent buck teeth that earn him the nickname &quot;the rat.&quot; While Hunt enthuses that a Formula One car is essentially &quot;a bomb on wheels,&quot; Lauda sees racing as merely a means to an end. &quot;If I had more talent and could win more money at something else,&quot; he explains at one point, &quot;I would.&quot;
