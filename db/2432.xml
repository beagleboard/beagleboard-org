Principal reduction may have made sense when housing prices were stuck in the mud, and underwater homeowners otherwise had no hope of getting out from under their debts. But forcing lenders to write down the principal they are owed now works at cross purposes with the administration&apos;s professed interest in reducing the government&apos;s enormous footprint in the mortgage markets. It&apos;s hard to entice private capital back into those markets when, at the same time, you are brandishing the ax of forcible principal reduction over the head of current investors.

Its solid execution and marketing strategy result in fast asset turnover, as demonstrated by 1.4x of contracted sales/total debt in 2012, and over 80% year-on-year growth in contracted sales to CNY20.3bn in H113. Fitch expects the outperformance to continue for the rest of 2013.

They knocked booming serves and flat, hard groundies at each other until one or the other flubbed a backhand into the net or sailed a forehand long.
