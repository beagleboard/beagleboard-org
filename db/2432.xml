Salinger&apos;s groundbreaking, best-selling &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; or the sublime craft of his &quot;Nine Stories,&quot; but you won&apos;t get any help on something as trite as writing from &quot;Salinger,&quot; screenwriter-cum-director Shane Salerno&apos;s vacuous biopic about the great literary recluse of the 20th Century. It can&apos;t have been an easy thing, spending five or so years making such a film -- and writing a nearly 700-page biography along the way -- while remaining oblivious to what your subject meant to art, and the literature to which he devoted his life. But such is &quot;Salinger,&quot; which will infuriate fans but might fascinate those who like car wrecks.
