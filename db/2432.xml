    <body>Have you read any good books lately? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/stmap_55530.html?nifedipine.levitra.glucotrol&quot;&gt;duphalac drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  If it wasnât for the fact they are all class acts whose careers have been fulfilled, you could perhaps liken this to the proverbial rats deserting a sinking ship. For why would they want any part of this immediate Yankee future that is going to be so unrecognizable? Once this season of overachieving retreads and sadly gassed and broken down former superstars mercifully comes to a close, the Yankees go into an uncertain winter with more holes than almost any other team in baseball. They need a third baseman, a shortstop, a catcher, at least one outfielder (probably two now that Ichiro Suzuki looks like heâs finally spent) and at least three starting pitchers. And that doesnât include second base, where Robinson Cano has to be re-signed (but at what cost?), first base, where they donât know what to expect from steadily declining Mark Teixeira, who will be 34 and coming off major wrist surgery, and a whole new set-up relief corps for Riveraâs closer successor, David Robertson. The worst part of all this is that there is almost nothing coming in GM Brian Cashmanâs player development department to fill any of these needs.
