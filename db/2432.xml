Soon he had a weekly slot with Radio Mil Diez called Canciones del Manana (Songs of the Morning), and began performing cabaret as one of a quintet, in clubs such as Sans Souci. The communist labour leader Lazaro Pena was an early devotee, and would pay regular visits to the Mil Diez, also hosting descargas (jam sessions) at his house. Portillo and his fellow filineros supported Mil Diez by running radio shows for free, and also performed at events hosted by the People&amp;rsquo;s Socialist Party (PSP). When the PSP was banned in 1948, Portillo joined the underground movement, helping to distribute the party&amp;rsquo;s weekly newsletter.
