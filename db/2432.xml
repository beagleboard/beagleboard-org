On top of this, he will also be eligible for a share award under the bank&amp;rsquo;s long-term incentive plan worth up to 400pc of his salary. He will also be granted a pension contribution equal to a quarter of the value of his annual pay. In total, this means he could earn as much as £6.2m a year.
