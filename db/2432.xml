Large entities have the resources to hire an army of lawyers and accountants to ensure they&apos;re taking advantage of every possible loophole. Most individual taxpayers, well, don&apos;t have that option. As a result, middle-income households end up paying nearly as much, and sometimes more, in taxes than the wealthiest Americans. And because big institutions can put their dollars to work lobbying the government for better treatment, the nature of the tax credits, write-offs and deductions carved into the code will skew more and more in their favor over time.
