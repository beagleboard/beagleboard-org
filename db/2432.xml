The latter has been looking into &quot;serious economic crimes&quot; and last week said bribes were generally paid through travel agencies or as &quot;project sponsorships&quot;. GSK is also suspected of being involved in tax-related crime, &quot;involving a large number of people and significant amounts of money&quot;.
