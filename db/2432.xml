    <body>Where are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/stmap_92e20.html?levitra.diovan.himcolin-gel.dipivoxil&quot;&gt;elocon online kaufen&lt;/a&gt;  @dksouthern. That is right my fellow citizen. Go back and do your homework. The press in this country was, at one time, independent and NOT reliant on corporate funds to do their bidding and propagandizing. In the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s, there was still enough room between GE and NBC for NBC to be truly independent enough to do real and HONEST reporting. Sure, not even independents are beyond bias. We all are. Also, I am not a boy. I am 55. 10 years serving the military. I am grew up in a working poor family of 4 children. I was fortunate enough to have support from the old Pell grant system that Carter provided that allowed me to work (with a decent minimum wage unlike the bs they pay now) and eventually get my graduate degree. You can take your snarly &quot;boy&quot; comment and shove it where the sun don&apos;t shine...
