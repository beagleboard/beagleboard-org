The animal side of âGimmieâ turns out to be less primal than campy. The goofy trumpeting of an elephant announces his erotic triumphs. âTrue Bloodâ has the silliness, and excess, of the video for Michael Jacksonâs âThriller,â complete with regular producer Timbaland mimicking Vincent Princeâs corny cackle.

The Giants had another three turnovers (two Eli Manning fumbles and one interception) and couldnât capitalize on a Big Blue defense that forced K.C. into its first three turnovers all season.
