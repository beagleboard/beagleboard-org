    <body>One moment, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/meridian-medical-group-avon-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;meridian medical group oakhurst nj&lt;/a&gt;  Thatâs not the vision I have for this country. Thatâs not the vision you have for this country. That is not the America we know. Thatâs not a vision we should settle for, or pass on to our children. I have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next one before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and thatâs how to use every minute of the 1,276 days remaining in my term to make this country work for working Americans again. Because I believe this is where America needs to go. I believe this is where the American people want to go. It may seem hard today, but if we are willing to take a few bold steps â if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship weâve seen these past few years â our economy will be stronger a year from now. And five years from now. And ten years from now. More Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck; the satisfaction of flipping the sign to âOpenâ on their own business; the joy of etching a childâs height into the door of their brand new home.
