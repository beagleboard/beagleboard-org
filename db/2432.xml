    <body>I&apos;m doing a masters in law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/wwwdana-farberorg-careers-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;www.dana-farber.org/&lt;/a&gt;  This applies exponentially to journalists, who might want to get back to basics &amp;ndash; especially when reporting sensitive stories. When I was reporting in Eastern Europe in the 1990s, almost no one would be interviewed on the phone. They had just ousted a communist regime, and they were convinced, still, that their phones were being tapped. They didn&apos;t even talk openly on the subway, so well-trained they were to be discreet. It made it harder to report, but it also promoted some better work tactics. I had to actually go meet someone somewhere and do interviews in person. I was less likely to misinterpret, and came back with more information than I would have gotten in a quick phone conversation. Woodward and Bernstein did it. So should the rest of us.
