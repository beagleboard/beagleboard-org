Earnings at S&amp;P 500 companies are up 4.3 percent this quarter, and revenue is down 0.4 percent, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. In previous eras, that hardly would have been considered encouraging. In the second quarter of 2007, before the financial crisis imploded, earnings rose 8.7 percent and revenue was up 5.8 percent. But compared with the second quarters of 2008 and 2009, when earnings plunged more than 20 percent each time, this year&apos;s results look positively cheery.
