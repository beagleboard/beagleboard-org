    <body>Yes, I love it! &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/steroidenbiz-7ef0.pdf#ever&quot;&gt;www.healthonmain.ca&lt;/a&gt;  Some light striking to start from both guys as Jung is looking to stand with Aldo. Aldo is being less aggressive than normal, looking for a counter. A nice combo counter and Jung is more cautious. Both men are being cautious, sticking and moving. Both guys aren&apos;t ready to get into a firefight just yet. Aldo cracks the first leg kick halfway through the round as he&apos;s being cautious. Jung is cautious as well; he wants to take this later into the fight and Aldo isn&apos;t going to give him an early opening. It&apos;s an interesting gambit because he&apos;s not trying to grind him down, like Edgar did, with his movement. This is a feeling out round. Jung goes for a takedown and follows it with a good right that misses. Aldo with a double of his own and gets TKZ down, letting him back up quickly. Big knee from Aldo, followed by a spinning wheel kick that misses. Aldo 10-9.

His parents Vikki and Karl explained in an interview on ITV&apos;s This Morning, that doctors remain unable to diagnose Aidan but they hope to work out what is wrong with him by a process of elimination. They suspect he suffers with CLOVES Syndrome, a rare condition that causes blood vessel, skin and spinal abnormalities.
