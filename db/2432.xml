    <body>I&apos;m training to be an engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/stmap_f2c20.html?betapace.gemfibrozil.noroxin.cialis&quot;&gt;wwww.labimed.com.br&lt;/a&gt;  Did Trayvon make a stupid mistake when he doubled back and took Zimmerman on? Yes, he did. But Zimmerman made a stupid mistake when he got out of his vehicle. Both were bad choices. I understand what Trayvon did. He really didn&apos;t want to run in fear from some stranger in the dark. If he had been a little older and a little smarter, he would have run, because that&apos;s the best thing to do. But he was young and full of testosterone and macho, so he figured he would show this stalker not to mess with him. I also understand what Zimmerman did. He wanted to be a hero. He wanted to be the guy that everyone admired for his courage. Unfortunately, part of his courage was embodied in a gun. When things didn&apos;t go the way he planned, he chose to use that gun. Tragically, a young man died.
