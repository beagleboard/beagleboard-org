    <body>Hello good day &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?cialis.mometasone.potassium&quot;&gt;generic viagra forum uk&lt;/a&gt;  Even if proof can be produced, military intervention must be aimed at punishing Assad â not at trying to swing the civil war in a particular direction. Early on in the conflict, it was possible to say that the rebels were the good guys and Assad was the bad guy. But now al Qaeda and other extremist groups have joined the rebels. While some advocates of intervention think the West should supply sophisticated weapons to the remaining moderates, thereâs a great risk that arms will fall into the wrong hands and moderates will become extremists. Meanwhile, the West rightly doesnât have the stomach for putting troops on the ground, following the disasters of Iraq and Afghanistan.
