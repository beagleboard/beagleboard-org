    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/recept-keftaballetjes-79a8.pdf&quot;&gt;recept keftaballetjes&lt;/a&gt;  Although you appear to satisfy the provisions relating to capital stock and a reserve, you do not satisfy the other organizational requirements of § 501(c)(16). State has suspended your corporate status; therefore you do not meet the first organizational requirement of § 501(c)(16). You also have not shown that you were created by a § 521 farmersâ cooperative or that your incorporators were members of a § 521 exempt farmersâ cooperative, and as such, do not meet the second organizational requirement. Finally, your articles of incorporation state that you were âformed for the pleasure, recreation and other non-profit purposes authorized under § 501(c)(16).â As âpleasureâ and ârecreationâ are not exempt purposes listed under § 501(c)(16) or the accompanying regulations, you do not completely satisfy the third organizational requirement.
