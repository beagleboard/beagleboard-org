    <body>Very funny pictures &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.layeredonline.com/stmap_dd540.html?levitra.lithium.itraconazole.lotemax&quot;&gt;pumpkin seed oil 1000 mg supplement benefits&lt;/a&gt;  As Wisse&amp;rsquo;s book states, by 1975 an estimated three quarters of US comedy professionals were Jewish. The author ascribes this American enthusiasm for Jewish humour in part to the creation of Israel. &amp;ldquo;The perception of Jews as a people taking hold of their future appealed to Americans,&amp;rdquo; she writes, &amp;ldquo;who valued a similar capacity for pulling themselves up by their bootstraps&amp;rdquo;. As someone who is unsympathetic to many of the current actions of the state of Israel, Wisse&amp;rsquo;s assertion made me uneasy, though I had to admit on reflection that there is perhaps some truth in it.
