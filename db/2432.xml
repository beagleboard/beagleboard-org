    <body>Where do you come from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/stmap_93920.html?parafon.levitra.poxet&quot;&gt;healthbrio.com&lt;/a&gt;  David Arquette&apos;s started off 2011 trying to ditch his increasingly noticeable alcohol addiction. The actor, who separated from his wife Courteney Cox, checked into rehab, gossip blog PerezHilton.com reports. Since separating from the former &apos;Friends&apos; star, Arquette has been noticeably living it up. In November, he tweeted pictures of himself partying it up in Miami &amp;#150; in one he&apos;s dancing on a table in what he refers to as &apos;a little gay dance party.&apos; At the time, friends defended him saying he was just trying to get over his breakup from his wife of 11 years.
