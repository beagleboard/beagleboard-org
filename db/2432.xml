    <body>We need someone with qualifications &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/healthdocboxcom-7684.pdf&quot;&gt;unhelpfulmedicine.com&lt;/a&gt;  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke triggered the selloff in the bondmarket and widespread outflows from bond funds when he toldCongress on May 22 that the central bank might reduce itsbond-buying stimulus later this year if the U.S. economy lookedstrong enough.

Last month, a deadline to rule on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley&apos;s continuedownership of trading assets like metal warehouses and oil storage tanks passed without word fromthe Fed.

The Infosyses and the Wipros are no longer the attraction for engineers graduating from a good college,â Srinivasan added. âThe confidence of guys who have spent two, three, four years working is dramatically different. They&apos;re no longer looking up to their parents for advice.â
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/tylenolprofessionalcomfever-6865.pdf#recorded&quot;&gt;www.tylenolprofessional.com/&lt;/a&gt;  There&apos;s no doubt that Washington in general and Congress in particular are at an historic level of dysfunction. They can&apos;t agree on a budget, can&apos;t manage to do even the basic work of the legislative body, let alone put their heads together for big-idea proposals to address climate change, entitlements or education. But there&apos;s an unfortunate tendency in the chattering class to throw up one&apos;s collective hands and accuse Obama &amp;ndash; and sometimes Boehner &amp;ndash; of failing to show &quot;leadership.&quot;

Hard cases make bad law, and when your entire reason for taking action can be boiled down to Greece-and-Griesa, two cases which are highly unique and idiosyncratic, then you&amp;#8217;re always going to run the risk of overreach. The big story in emerging markets over the past decade is that their local debt markets have become much deeper and more liquid, meaning that they&amp;#8217;re increasingly capable of funding themselves domestically. And domestic debt is not an issue: any time a government wants to default on its domestic debt it can, or alternatively it can just print money to cover the obligations.
