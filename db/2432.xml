    <body>Excellent work, Nice Design &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?dimenhydrinate.hytrin.levitra&quot;&gt;apte4ka.com coupon&lt;/a&gt;  Theoderic&amp;rsquo;s new empire did not last; nor did the attempts at imperial revival conducted by Heather&amp;rsquo;s other two subjects here, Justinian and Charlemagne. One clue that explains why no successor empire could rival the extraordinary durability of the Roman Empire lies in the story of Theoderic. In the first centuries BC and AD the Romans had little difficulty guarding their imperial frontiers against Germanic tribes. The military machines raised by leaders such as Theoderic half a millennium later were entirely different. &amp;ldquo;Long-term transformation had created the building blocks for really large and lasting military formations capable of slicing off large slices of Roman territory.&amp;rdquo;
