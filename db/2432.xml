    <body>On another call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssvoverath.de/stmap_c3db0.html?butenafine.sparfloxacin.levitra.tamoxifen&quot;&gt;he upbraideth not&lt;/a&gt;  Buckley correctly held that spending money is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. But the court only found caps on expenditures &amp;ndash; and not on the contributions that enable them &amp;ndash; to be unconstitutional, reasoning that &quot;while contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.&quot; While the court has since abandoned the concept of &quot;speech by proxy,&quot; the contribution-expenditure distinction remains. That distinction has been the target of persistent criticism and its underlying logic was repudiated in subsequent decisions.
