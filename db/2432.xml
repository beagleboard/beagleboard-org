Crocker gained fame over the last decade as the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was the most experienced troubleshooter in the American Foreign Service. But in the early 1980s, Crocker was the diplomat in charge of the Beirut embassyâs political section. He was the first diplomat on the scene to witness the butchery in Sabra and Shatila in September 1982. He was blown against the wall of his office by the explosion that brought down the entire front of the embassy in April 1983. And he was there in Beirut when the explosive cloud rose over the BLT Headquarters 30 years ago.
