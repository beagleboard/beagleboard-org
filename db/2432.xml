Bums me out that Hollywood is so thin obsessed,&quot; wrote one viewer, another observed that there was &quot;too much starvation on the red carpet&quot; and urged the actresses to &quot;run to in-and-out burger,&quot; and another quipped: &quot;I&apos;m used to seeing skinny Hollywood actresses, but the images I&apos;m seeing on twitter from the Emmys are shocking.
