 &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldnewsnetwork.co.in/ultramediccompl-08d2.pdf&quot;&gt;www.saverxcanada.to&lt;/a&gt;  anarcurt, I agree with what you are saying in principle for sure. The wealthy can be quite despicable. The tax code must be re-written as soon as possible. The wealthy don&amp;#8217;t want to. Mr. Summers does (even though he&amp;#8217;s wealth). I believe he leans very far to the left and would actually, as he titled this article, target untaxed wealth. Again. Different story. Taxing wealth means if you have a pot of money that fits the description of wealth, then the government should tax it every year. Eventually, if you are not replenishing the wealth, it runs out and you are wealthy no more. I think that is wrong and goes to far. The wealthy are a necessary evil.
