    <body>Yes, I play the guitar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipepalmas.com.br/stmap_7fc80.html?varenicline.viagra.cleocin&quot;&gt;zenegra opinie&lt;/a&gt;  But while she was becoming serious about her athletics, Perri didn&amp;rsquo;t pack away her school books. &amp;ldquo;My two priorities in life were always athletics and education,&amp;rdquo; she maintains. &amp;ldquo;I was not the smartest in my class at school by any means, and it would have been easier just to stick to the athletics, but my Mum kept saying to me: &apos;What happens if you get injured? You&amp;rsquo;ll need a back-up career.&amp;rsquo; So I studied for my A-levels at school, and then went to do a sports science degree at Brunel University. I set myself the goal of getting a 2:1, and I did. Like my athletics, I put all my effort into it. Because what I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered is that when you experience success, you want more.&amp;rdquo;
