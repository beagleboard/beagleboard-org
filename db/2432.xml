    <body>I saw your advert in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/how-well-does-promescent-work-e0f9.pdf#tuesday&quot;&gt;is promescent worth it&lt;/a&gt;  Four albums in, does Turner ever look back at Arctic Monkeys&amp;rsquo; hectic, hyped early days? &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really, no. A fleeting moment every now and then if someone asks me. But in terms of being busy day-to-day, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any difference between then and now. All that stuff was in the exterior, out on the perimeter&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t really remember to tell you the truth,&amp;rsquo; he says, laughing, just. &amp;lsquo;Yeah, what did we do? We put that album out, everyone went mad for it&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; An audible shrug. &amp;lsquo;But as far as our day-to-day, we still do the same stuff now &amp;ndash; do things like this [interview], then do a show.&amp;rsquo;
