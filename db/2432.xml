In all, they examined 33 orphaned chimpanzees, including 12 infants that were between one and four years and 21 juveniles that were between 5 and 8 years. During trials, a human repeatedly either yawned, gaped or nose-wiped during one session and then followed it by three sessions where these key behaviors weren&apos;t used.Â  Each set of trials was performed by an unfamiliar human and a familiar human.
