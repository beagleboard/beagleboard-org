It gets worse for the defund crowd. Not only do independents oppose defunding by 44-40, but that margin balloons to 65-14 when a shutdown enters the equation. And even Republicans (who support defunding in general by 51-36) oppose the defund plan 48-36 when shutdown or default enter the mix. It will surprise no one that the only subgroup favoring defunding even if it means a shutdown is tea-party-supporting Republicans.

The Giants declined to re-sign Jacobs after Super Bowl XLVI, so he signed a one-year, $1.6 million deal with the Niners. But a summer knee injury limited his effectiveness and he quickly fell out of favor with 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh. Late in the season, he tweeted his frustration, saying he was ârotting awayâ in San Francisco, enduring âby far the worst year I ever had.â

U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press that the Navy had sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern Mediterranean Sea but without immediate orders for any missile launch into Syria.

Picpoul has become fiendishly popular and this is my pick of this summer&amp;rsquo;s bottles.
