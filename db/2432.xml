And he is working with a receiving corps that charitably can be called mediocre. Still, other than the opening game against Alabama, he has not played against a good defense (FCS patsy Western Carolina, East Carolina and Marshall do not register among the nation&apos;s stingiest units).

I hear people all the time (and yes, mostly on these forums) saying they HAVE to have guns in their home to protect them for all the rapists, burglars, and murderers who invade their homes. But, of course, all these people also keep their guns &quot;safe&quot;, meaning the gun is one place and the ammo in another (this to keep accidents from happening). I guess my question is, do these homeowners thing the rapists, burglars, and murderers are going to wait for the homeowner to load the stupid gun?????

He was the leading scorer in the league last year and you read it in the paper. I donât watch other guys play a lot. All I can do is read and see at the end of the season, âOh, heâs the leading scorer.â
