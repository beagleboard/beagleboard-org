He wasnât religious in any conventional sense, but heâd been born a Jew, which had been noted on his Russian passport to remind everyone of the fact. As a Jew he expected to be given especially difficult entrance exams to university, which, if he passed them, would grant him access to just one of two Moscow universities that were more accepting of Jews. Heâd been willing to tolerate this state of affairs; however, as it happened, heâd also been born to program computers.

The more challenging problem is not to play chess but to write the code that will play chess.â He found that coding engaged him not just intellectually but also emotionally. âWriting a program is like giving birth to a child,â he says. âIt is a creation. Even though it is technical, it is a work of art. You get this level of satisfaction.â

But it has also said that this is the only justification for limiting political spending. It has also made clear that money given to someone other than a candidate does not create a sufficient risk of corruption to outweigh the First Amendment interest in making them.
