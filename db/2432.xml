    <body>Yes, I play the guitar &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/om-healthcom-a511.pdf#blouse&quot;&gt;bristolmedicalcentre.com&lt;/a&gt;  Iranians will âsafeguard their national interestsâ and âcannot be made to surrender through sanctions; such a people cannot be threatened to war and fighting,â said Rohani, according to a simultaneous translation by state-run PressTV. âThe only way for interaction with Iran is a dialogue on an equal footing, confidence-building which should be mutual, and mutual respect as well as reducing antagonism and aggressiveness... I want to clearly express, that if you want the right response [on the nuclear issue], it should not be through the language of sanctions, it should be through the language and discourse of respect,â Rohani said, prompting the loudest applause of his swearing-in speech.
