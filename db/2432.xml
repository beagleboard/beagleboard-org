    <body>This is the job description &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/nacptpharmacollegecom-b01a.pdf&quot;&gt;blog.medicinehouse.com&lt;/a&gt;  From an economic standpoint, this fatalism is unjustified.If quality news and analysis have significant value tocustomers, then the people providing these services willeventually find ways to get paid. It is often claimed that thenews has become worthless because Internet distribution involveszero marginal cost, but this is poor economics. The true cost ofnews lies not in distribution, but in the research, composition,selection and editing required for high quality writing. Thesecosts are as high as ever today.

Brain Pickings is not how I make a living â it&amp;#8217;s MY LIFE, Felix. Every waking moment goes into it one way or another â the enormous amount of time it takes to read books, to research, to meet with people, to interview, and even to do this right now, and of course to write 3 articles a day Monday through Friday, between 300 and 3000 words each. (Add to that the time of my proofreader and any intern at any given time, plus designer and developer when needed.) And here&amp;#8217;s the thing â I do it not to &amp;#8220;build an audience&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;generate revenue&amp;#8221; or any of that, but because it gives me enormous joy and stimulation. It makes me excited to wake up and fulfilled to go to bed. And I guess what it boils down to is that the fraction of the world that&amp;#8217;s ever come across Brain Pickings and cares will just have to take my word for it. Those who don&amp;#8217;t are free to ask me questions, which I will always answer as honestly as I can and as completely as time permits, or they&amp;#8217;re free to move on. But Brain Pickings is my home â and people interested in hostile takedowns, like Tom seems to be, rather than in understanding what moves me or having an intelligent conversation about things, are simply not welcome in it.
