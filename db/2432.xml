The whole 60 vote thing is later tweeking. It&apos;s Senate rules. Now they call the regular simple majority the nuclear option (the press is really annoying like that). I know the Democrats have used the 60 vote thing too when they didn&apos;t have the White House, still it is time for it to go because the government has to function and these offices have to be filled. These positions are even required by law in many cases. They should amend the Senate rules so that appointments only require a simple majority and cannot be filibustered whenever any office has gone unfilled for longer than two months, or something of that nature.

It and other Morsi supporters vow they will not stop protests until he is returned to office, and they have said there will be no negotiations with the new leadership unless it accepts his reinstatement. They have denied any back-channel talks are taking place.
