    <body>Where are you calling from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/scmedicalorg-6a83.pdf&quot;&gt;chiphealth.com/login/&lt;/a&gt;  There are many factors that influence the path of an asteroid through space. Its spin rate, reflectivity (albedo), composition, mass, terrain variationsâ¦ gravitational interactions with other bodies, some of which may not even have been discovered yetâ¦ all of these can affect the movement of an asteroid and, more specifically, its exact position at a future point in time. While many of these things still arenât precisely known for 1950 DA, one in particular could end up being the saving grace for our descendants: the Yarkovsky effect.
