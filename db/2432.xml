    <body>What do you study? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/stmap_0a7b0.html?lopid.cialis.avigra.almond-cucumber&quot;&gt;culturelle probiotic reviews&lt;/a&gt;  Halfakerâs study, which he conducted with a Minnesota colleague and researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington, analyzed Wikipediaâs public activity logs. The results paint a numerical picture of a community dominated by bureaucracy. Since 2007, when the new controls began to bite, the likelihood of a new participantâs edit being immediately deleted has steadily climbed. Over the same period, the proportion of those deletions made by automated tools rather than humans grew. Unsurprisingly, the data also indicate that well-intentioned newcomers are far less likely to still be editing Wikipedia two months after their first try.
