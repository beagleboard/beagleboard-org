    <body>Yes, I love it! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlam.com/index.php/stmap_77410.html?bactrim.v-gel.viagra&quot;&gt;gohealthuc.com/nyc&lt;/a&gt;  Model helicopter enthusiasts and park-goers looked on in horror Thursday as a teen was struck and instantly killed by his own remote-controlled helicopter in a Brooklyn park. Roman Pirozek Jr., 19, apparently lost control of his model helicopter while trying to perform a trick. The copter sliced off the top of his head and part of his shoulder as his father and fellow RC helicopter enthusiasts were watching, law enforcement officials said.
