A rep for Olivia Wilde and the SNL funnyman confirmed on Jan. 12, 2013 that the pair is engaged. The next day, the 28-year-old actress was sporting a shiny new engagement ring in Italy. Now that&apos;s amore! Both Wilde and Sudeikis were previously hitched. Wilde finalized her divorce from her husband of 8 years, Tao Ruspoli, in 2011. Sudeikis was married to &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot; screenwriter Kay Cannon before their divorce in 2010.
