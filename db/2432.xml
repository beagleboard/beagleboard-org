    <body>What sort of music do you like? &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/tetracycline-medicine-for-fish-9392.pdf&quot;&gt;tetracycline makes acne worse&lt;/a&gt;  I think, Jim, what I was alluding to is the fact that, number one, we have, even with the Belo transaction, an incredibly strong balance sheet, and this just actually enhances our cash flow generation and actually strengthens our balance sheet. So we have a lot of flexibility. We are not just focused on Broadcast. We are focused on any opportunity that will provide us with higher-margin, higher-growth businesses at the right price. Obviously, always -- that&apos;s always a constraint. As to the 39% cap, we will be about -- on a reported basis, about 30% with the addition of Belo. But there&apos;s a difference between the way you count UHF versus VHF. So actually, for FCC rule purposes, Dave, we&apos;re about, what, 23% or 24%.
