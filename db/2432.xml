    <body>Who would I report to? &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/toppharmacynet-a511.pdf#fragile&quot;&gt;www.toppharmacy.net&lt;/a&gt;  Hammarskjold brought to the job a rigorous interpretation of what it means to be an international civil servant and to have a UN Secretariat &amp;ldquo;as something lifted above all national contexts.&amp;rdquo; Staff should be assumed to be loyal to the UN rather than to their own countries, whose interests they are bound not to consider above others. His views on this developed during his time of office, culminating in a famous Oxford lecture in 1961. Integrity ranked even higher than strict neutrality. If integrity in the sense of respect for law and truth were to drive the international civil servant into positions of conflict with a particular interest, &amp;ldquo;then that conflict is a sign of his neutrality and not of his failure to observe neutrality,&amp;rdquo; and thus it is fully in line with his duties. This is an observation that many UN staff are tempted to trot out whenever they are harangued by a national diplomat for not having shown &amp;ldquo;proper neutrality&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;by which is meant having done something not in line with the political interest of that diplomat&amp;rsquo;s government.
