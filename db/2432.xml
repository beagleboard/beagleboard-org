    <body>We&apos;ve got a joint account &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/stark-pharmacy-menorah-hours-6865.pdf&quot;&gt;stark pharmacy at menorah&lt;/a&gt;  Which has made the pitch something of a human drama as well as a scientific one. Not only was the pitch drop a literally blink-and-you-miss-it occurrence ... but the experiments seeking to see it also found themselves, in some sense, on the wrong side of technological history.

The data desired -- the breakaway moment -- required human eyes, watching as patiently (and, ideally, as unblinkingly) as possible.
