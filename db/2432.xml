    <body>Sorry, I ran out of credit &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/twitter-rois-medical-69bc.pdf#delirium&quot;&gt;rois medical&lt;/a&gt;  This would explain why First lady Michelle Obama&apos;s healthy lifestyle website is still up and running while the Department of Justice shuttered &amp;ndash; at least temporarily &amp;ndash; the missing child &quot;Amber Alert&quot; page. It would also explain why the National Park Service, when it discovered it could not close George Washington&apos;s Mt. Vernon because it is privately owned and operated, closed the parking lots and the traffic circle where tour buses would unload. It&apos;s also why Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid was allowed to get away with the biggest political faux pas of the decade thus far when he consigned children suffering from cancer to their death.
