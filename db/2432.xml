He went out of his way to bring people down (in reference to the sample collector who was fired after Braunâs lawyers successfully got his initial positive drug test overturned on a chain of custody issue) and covered up his lies and now he looks like Lance Armstrong. Thereâs so much player outrage at him because of how brash he was against MLB and how brash he was in his defense.â

But it acknowledged characterizations of the GOP as &quot;narrow minded,&quot; &quot;out of touch&quot; and a party of &quot;stuffy old men&quot; &amp;#x2014; labels used in focus groups of former Republican voters.
