    <body>Can I take your number? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/accessiblemedsorg-7684.pdf#affectionate&quot;&gt;my.collegiumpharma.com&lt;/a&gt;  Hence the prevalence of what has come to be derisively known as the &quot;Green Lantern Theory of Presidential Power&quot; &amp;ndash; named for the DC Comics character whose powers derive from his strength of will &amp;ndash; which states that President Obama ought to be able to get his agenda passed through an intractable opposition by sheer force of will and an exercise of &quot;leadership.&quot; Obama used a slightly different formulation back in the spring when he chided reporters that he couldn&apos;t perform a &quot;Jedi mind meld&quot; on Republicans to get them to support his ideas. The problem with the Green Lantern theory is that it ignores the reality of a determined Republican opposition that controls the House and is both capable of keeping the Senate in a state of gridlock and willing to do so. Even great leadership requires some level of followership.
