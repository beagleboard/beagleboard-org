This reflects our assessment of strong operational and strategic, and moderate legal ties between KTGA and KTG. KTG, Kazakhstan&apos;s national gas operator, maintains and develops country&apos;s domestic and transit gas pipelines and sells natural gas domestically and for export. KTGA is responsible for KTG&apos;s domestic operations including domestic gas transportation and sales of natural gas. KTGA benefits from the links with the state, which are embedded in KTG&apos;s ratings.
