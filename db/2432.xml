    <body>Directory enquiries &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/can-you-take-ibuprofen-with-alka-seltzer-cold-medicine-2206.pdf&quot;&gt;can you take ibuprofen with azithromycin and prednisone&lt;/a&gt;  Long before I found myself in the delivery room, I had worked with a team from the BBC&amp;rsquo;s old Heart of the Matter strand &amp;ndash; the Sunday evening TV discussion chaired by Joan Bakewell &amp;ndash; about making a programme, tentatively entitled The Maternal Male, on men who felt short-changed because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t have babies. There were some scientists around the world who believed it was physically possible. Male sea horses did it, after all. And so I was lined up to be one of the men on the panel who felt he was missing out. &apos;&apos;Thank God the programme didn&amp;rsquo;t go ahead,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; was all I could think during my long vigil on the maternity ward. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had a clue what I was talking about.
