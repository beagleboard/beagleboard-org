    <body>How long have you lived here? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/cialis-20mg-preis-trkei-b01a.pdf#specification&quot;&gt;lowest prices generic cialis&lt;/a&gt;  Crista Flanagan, who plays the switchboard operator on AMC&apos;s &apos;60s-set drama &apos;Mad Men,&apos; is rarely called for parts where she gets to play pretty, so she was intrigued that Playboy wanted her to pose in a &apos;60s-themed shoot. &apos;I guess I haven&apos;t been seen as a sexy person,&apos; she says, &apos;and sometimes not even as an attractive person.&apos; That may change now. Flanagan appears on two covers of the August issue of Playboy that were modeled after shots from the &apos;60s and inside in an eight-page layout that keeps the &apos;Mad Men&apos; theme. The folks at Playboy also reproduced classic ads from the period, too.
