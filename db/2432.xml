    <body>Through friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/wwwcommunitypharmacyscotnhsuk-79a8.pdf&quot;&gt;www.communitypharmacy.scot.nhs.uk&lt;/a&gt;  Gilligan and company have created an amazing run of seven episodes leading up to next week&amp;#8217;s finale; and yet they&amp;#8217;ve still posed themselves a challenge in pulling off a satisfying ending. I&amp;#8217;d now guess that the finale is building toward what it&amp;#8217;s looked like: some revenge plot against Jack and company, abetted by Jesse (who now has a reason powerful enough to ally even with Walt), then freeing up Walt and Jesse for some final, cathartic confrontation. (Though what do I know? Is Walt carrying a machine gun for Gretchen and Elliott too?) He offered his son his money and was rejected. He has nothing to give anyone anymore but his freedom, or his life.
