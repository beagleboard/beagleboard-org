    <body>What sort of work do you do? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/stmap_f2c20.html?tazalis.clomipramine.himcocid.viagra&quot;&gt;tamsulosin webmd&lt;/a&gt;  Besides the concerns about money, many students (and their parents, including mine) were worried about safety in Latin America. When I told people that I was going to Colombia the general consensus was that I was crazy. The images of Pablo Escobar still overshadow the international profile of the country, and the issues with the guerrillas, paramilitaries and FARC have done little to bring light to the murky picture. In truth, Colombia has been nothing like how people imagine it to be. While there are big issues regarding internal displacement and conflict, this does not make Colombia a no-go zone for foreigners to visit and work. Knock on wood, I have had no nasty experiences or muggings. That isnât to say that it isnât exciting and unpredictable living here, or that one has to take a bit more care than when in Europe, but the fear factor shouldnât be the one that is keeping you from boarding the plane.
