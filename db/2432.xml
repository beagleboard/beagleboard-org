Zanganeh said Iran, which cannot refine all the petrol it needs, had imported between 5 and 7 million liters a day of gasoline in the past six months.

In emerging markets, politics have at least as big an impact on market outcomes as the underlying economics &amp;#8212; thatâs why these kinds of protests can strike seemingly out of the blue, and bring business-as-usual to a halt. Compare the impact of protests (and leadersâ responses) in Brazil and Turkey to the Occupy Wall Street movement. In a developed country like the United States, the political system is consolidated in a manner that forces fringe movements to choose one of two paths: go mainstream or lose steam. In emerging markets that have experienced dramatic and rapid changes, governments canât keep up with citizensâ evolving demands. Protests are far more likely to swell, with severe economic ramifications.
