    <body>Very interesting tale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/greenlife-pharmaceuticals-limited-ilupeju-0a7b.pdf#catching&quot;&gt;greenlife pharmaceutical limited&lt;/a&gt;  So you just got bad news from the IRS via email. There&apos;s a link to click. You do it. And just like thatâ¦ Mazel Tov! You&apos;ve been spearphished. The IRS doesn&apos;t send bad news like this via email. There are lots of bad people out there who count on your knee-jerk reaction to do whatever it takes to satisfy your curiosity or solve a problem. It&apos;s best to assume that if you click the link, you will be creating a newer, much bigger problem for yourself.

My case in perticular involved an accident in which I hurt my back. Due to military climate in combat arms in which you never go on sick call I ignored the pain for several years and relied on the company medics endless supply of the magic orange pills (motrin). I finally went to a doctor while on leave and they discovered that I had actually cracked parts of my spine. It may have not mattered as far as not having sought medical care prior to then but various parts of my spine had calsified and there was nothing that could be done about it except deal with the pain. I was able to retire with over 20 years even though I did have to leave my beloved Infantry but when I was evaluated by the VA I was awarded 20 %. I appealed mainly because I noticed a mistake in the VA&apos;s write up and provided documentation proving my point and I guess I am one of the lucky ones because I was awarded the correct percentage after about 3 months.

The assumption of Assad&amp;#39;s rationality is not more than that &amp;mdash; an assumption.&quot;
