In 2009 Kenner had convinced some of the players to sue Jowdy, accusing him of spending $25 million of the playersâ money on strippers, porn stars and wild parties attended by Jowdy and his pals, including Roger Clemens and Joe Morgan. Jowdy has fought to dispel those claims, suing Kenner for defamation and telling The News that he often feared for his life as he battled to turn Diamante, which opened to rave reviews in 2010, into one of the highest-rated new golf courses in the world. (Tiger Woods recently signed on to design a second 18 at Diamante, which is scheduled to open next year.) The players&apos; suit against Jowdy was withdrawn in 2010.
