Be aware that phishing scams are rife about eBay, along with a host of others including utility providers and banks. Some such scam messages which have been reported on and sent to thousands of internet users say that the intended victim&amp;rsquo;s eBay account has been suspended.

They had a favorite kind of trail mix I can normally only find at Whole Foods, Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste and all the cleaning brands I&amp;#8217;m used to buying at Target or Walmart.
