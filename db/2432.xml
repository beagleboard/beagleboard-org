Scientists will attempt to determine which geo-engineering techniques are feasible and try to evaluate the impacts and risks of each (including &quot;national security concerns&quot;). One proposed geo-engineering method the study will look at is solar radiation management&amp;mdash;a fancy term for pumping particles into the stratosphere to reflect incoming sunlight away from the planet.
