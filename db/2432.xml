The ceremony was followed by a good old fashioned family barbecue.

Indeed, in his evidence to the Hutton inquiry, Sir Richard Dearlove, the head of MI6, described the 45-minute claim, straight-faced, as &amp;ldquo;a piece of well-sourced intelligence&amp;rdquo;, two months after his own service had discredited it. Despite his key role as Dearlove&amp;rsquo;s military counterpart, General Laurie was never called to Hutton at all; his explosive statement, and that of the two MI6 people, emerged only in 2011, at the Chilcot inquiry.
