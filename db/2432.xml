    <body>Which year are you in? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/r-pharm-bd82.pdf#illegal&quot;&gt;r-pharm pipeline&lt;/a&gt;  At approximately 9.10pm the pie came out of the oven and dinner was served. The pie had no soggy bottom, although with the amount of pastry present, I had never really feared any drop of moisture would get through that cement-like case, and the layers of vegetables and cheese were visible - sort of. Cutting a slice was quite tricky as the sides collapsed a bit &amp;ndash; but other than that it looked good and my flatmate really enjoyed it.
