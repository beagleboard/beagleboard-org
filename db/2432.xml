    <body>My battery&apos;s about to run out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/stmap_9e880.html?duralast.viagra.nootropil&quot;&gt;clonidine mg&lt;/a&gt;  Holding schools accountable for teaching their students is a good thing. And giving parents an easy way to understand how schools are doing is critical; an A to F grading scale is something we are all familiar with and understand. It is also critical that parents, schools and teachers know exactly how school grading standards are determined and applied and they must be applied fairly to all schools. There must be total transparency in any school accountability process and state school superintendents should open the books to anyone who would like to examine how they are applying grading standards to their public schools.
