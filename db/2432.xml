And so, Don Lemon has finally decided to come clean. The CNN anchor reveals in his memoir, &apos;Transparent,&apos; that he is gay. &quot;People are going to say: &apos;Oh, he was molested as a kid and now he is coming out,&quot; Lemmon said in an interview with The New York Times, acknowledging that details about his personal life will probably garner more headlines than his insights on the journalism industry.
