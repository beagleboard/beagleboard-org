The Fed will continue to print money until the dollar is inflated to nothing and they have completed the greatest robbery in the history of the world stealing the wealth of the American people and transferring it to the ultra rich globalist banking cartel. It&amp;#8217;s these that really control what is going on in America, the one&amp;#8217;s bankrolling these corrupt politicians, the puppet masters behind the scenes of those supposedly representing the people.

What is it about the front line that disqualifies their patriotism, commitment, physical strength, skill and mental aptitude from relevance? Nothing - which implies that it must be something to do with their gender. But that argument is unsatisfactory; women obviously have a huge range of abilities that could do precious work on the front line. Inhibiting them from doing so is both unjust discrimination and counter-productive. Finally, at a time of widespread cutbacks in military spending, it&apos;s clear that beggars can&apos;t be choosers. Our enemies are multiplying while our resources are shrinking. Therefore we need all the help we can get on the front line - and excluding half our population makes no sense at all.
