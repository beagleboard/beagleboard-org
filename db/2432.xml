She was clearly there because she wanted to be seen. Like it was, like, terrible and I had to like - she would like, she would just not show up for work,&quot; said Morgan.

Forrest Whitaker is a great actor and he has some really good scenes, as does his son, played by David Oyelowo, but these scenes feel almost out of place amid the broad, low brow, and fairly obvious tone of the rest of the film. And to top it off, the movie is twenty minutes too long, the result of which is that by the time a pivotal character dies, a scene that could have been a tear jerker had it not been broadcast from a mile away, my group was shifting in our seats and stifling laughs. âLee Danielâs The Butlerâ is a movie that you feel like you should see, and having seen it, should like it. âThis is important and demanding of your respect,â the film seems to say. The Civil Rights Movement was important and demanding of respect, and on this anniversary, we do well to remember it. This movie, on the other hand? Not so much. Grade: D
