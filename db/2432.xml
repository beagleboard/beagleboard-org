    <body>Another year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/myoleptin-cla-1000-mg-180-softgels-7684.pdf#cautiously&quot;&gt;cla 1000 gnc dosage&lt;/a&gt;  He left Abreu stranded at second that inning, and got out of a two-on, no-out situation in the ninth by getting the Giantsâ two best hitters âBuster Posey on a popup and Hunter Pence on a double-play grounder to short. And he was prepared to keep pitching into the 10th â and who knows how much beyond that? â if the Yankees were able to tie the score. In between innings, Pettitte tapped him on the shoulder and said: âWay to go âOld Man.â â The Yankees, however, were not able to tie the score and extend Riveraâs day, which, up on the scoreboard, became more and more disheartening with news that Tampa Bay and Cleveland, the two teams leading the wild-card hunt, had won.
