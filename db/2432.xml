My dad, on his first day at school, was accosted by a massive bully, a kid about twice his size, who intended to beat him up. The product of a home where his own father left when he was very young and where he had to fight for love, attention and money like a lobster trying to scrabble out of a pot, dragged down by his brothers, my dad was in no mood to be bullied by this cowardly creature. The boy hit him and then my dad struck back, knocking him down and sitting on his chest punching him until he was dragged away. He was never bullied again.
