    <body>Gloomy tales &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?procardia.bystolic.frumil.viagra&quot;&gt;go-gx.com&lt;/a&gt;  If there&apos;s a problem with the brilliant twist, it&apos;s that it&apos;s begging for a conclusion that The Wind Waker can&apos;t deliver. As polished as it was and is, this game had a rushed development that resulted in substantial cuts - two dungeons were removed, leaving just four, none of them really a classic - and a few fairly obvious bits of recycling and make-do design, including an underwhelming climactic area (although the final fight with Ganondorf is superbly staged). The cracks are very carefully papered over and you could hardly call the game too short, but it can&apos;t help feeling truncated, like it&apos;s missing something.
