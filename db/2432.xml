    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/lumimedgr-a511.pdf#grotesque&quot;&gt;rad-med.gr&lt;/a&gt;  While thereâs plenty of season left â and with a win, this teamâs Super Bowl aspirations will be completely intact â the Giants will arrive at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte feeling the pressure of their pride. Theyâve labeled this a must-win game, such a must-win that their coach, Tom Coughlin, barely missed a minute with the team last week despite battling what he called an âemotional tug of warâ after the death of his only brother, John Coughlin, on Monday. Itâs such a must-win that, after a preseason filled with injuries and missed workouts, just about every Giant â with the exception of CB Corey Webster (hip), who did not make the trip to Charlotte, and OL David Diehl (thumb) â found a way to practice throughout the week.
