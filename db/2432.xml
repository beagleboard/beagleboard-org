Rowe Price funds held a combined5 percent stake in Facebook Inc Class A shares before thesocial media company went public last year. Facebook&apos;s stocktumbled after its debut. But the stock is now trading above $50a share, or 32.5 percent above the IPO price, outperforming theS&amp;P 500 Index by 5.5 percentage points during that span.
