For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors.

Emergency workers said that along with the dead, nine others were critically injured and 60 less seriously hurt. But a spokesman stressed that the figures were only provisional. Some of the dead and injured were said to have been electrocuted by contact with the 25,000-volt overhead power lines which were brought down. The president of the French state railways (SNCF) Guillaume Pepy spoke last night of a ârail catastropheâ.

They recruited 60 elderly subjects for the new study. Since they suspected that flavanol would improve the subjects&amp;rsquo; thinking skills and blood flow, they randomly assigned subjects to drink either flavanol-rich or flavanol-poor hot chocolate.
