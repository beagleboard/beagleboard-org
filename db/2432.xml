A previous offer was rejected in May and he risks a much heftier sentence if no plea bargain is agreed. Hearings resume in September.

Neale Albert, a 75-year-old former lawyer, has been collecting them for 20 years. The reason, he says, speaking from his home in Manhattan, is practical: &amp;ldquo;What would you do,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;if you loved to collect things and you lived in a two-bedroom apartment?&amp;rdquo; Yet as time went on, and his collection swelled to 3,500 volumes, Albert found it necessary to purchase a second apartment to accommodate his burgeoning library. Julian Edison was hooked by miniature books in 1960, when his wife presented him with a complete miniature set of Shakespeare on their first wedding anniversary: &amp;ldquo;I said what you would say, &apos;Wow! I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like that.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Four years later, the library of a chemist, Percy Spielmann, came up for auction; Edison bought all 800 books, housed in custom-made Lilliputian bookcases, and his collection now runs to 15,000 volumes.
