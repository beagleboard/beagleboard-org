    <body>I live in London &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/beyondskincom-coupon-9392.pdf&quot;&gt;beyondskin.com coupon&lt;/a&gt;  CÃ©line has a strong performance and touring history. She has performed consistently and reliably for years and always draws huge numbers. MJ hadn&apos;t had a top-earning tour since the 1987-1989 Bad Tour and he was notoriously unreliable as a business partner from the mid-&apos;90s onward. I can understand how a concert executive would determine that a star with a solid performance record and high ticket sales is bigger than one with few recent performances, let alone tours or residencies. It&apos;s not that MJ wasn&apos;t more famous (he was and is) but that he hadn&apos;t made good on his earning potential as a live artist for many years. That&apos;s how I interpreted his opinion on the two artists.
