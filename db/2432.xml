    <body>What do you like doing in your spare time? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/globepharma-79a8.pdf#parking&quot;&gt;globepharma versa press release&lt;/a&gt;  Views differ on what would happen if that biomass vanished. Bruce Harrison, an entomologist at the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Winston-Salem estimates that the number of migratory birds that nest in the tundra could drop by more than 50% without mosquitoes to eat. Other researchers disagree. Cathy Curby, a wildlife biologist at the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Fairbanks, Alaska, says that Arctic mosquitoes don&apos;t show up in bird stomach samples in high numbers, and that midges are a more important source of food. &quot;We (as humans) may overestimate the number of mosquitoes in the Arctic because they are selectively attracted to us,&quot; she says.
