    <body>I do some voluntary work &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/xlmedicinescom-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;your-pharmacy.us&lt;/a&gt;  But there&apos;s no evidence that sober coaching works. Studies of effectiveness don&apos;t exist. And the specialty has no formal structure or discipline &amp;ndash; coaches are not overseen by a governing body, they are unregulated and there is no standardized or accepted training. Some coaches are recovering addicts drawing from their own struggles with addiction. Others are trained drug counselors, social workers or psychotherapists, or have worked at residential treatment centers. &quot;Sober coaches don&apos;t necessarily have a sophisticated education &amp;ndash; and because of the amount of money they&apos;re charging, one would expect some sophistication,&quot; says Westley Clark, director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&apos; Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. &quot;It becomes a matter of what are you buying, what do you get?&quot;
