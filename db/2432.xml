From its belvederes, 1,700ft above sea level, you can look back towards Cap d&amp;rsquo;Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, Cannes and St-Tropez, names synonymous with Hollywood glamour, and forwards to the craggy massifs of the Alpes Maritime. Directly below is the Moyenne Corniche, a lower road passing under rock arches, over ravines and through an ancient landscape dotted with poplars and turreted châteaux, with the sparkling Mediterranean beyond. It is coastline of coves, rocky headlands, marinas, grand hotels, well-groomed beaches and world-famous restaurants.
