    <body>How many more years do you have to go? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?levitra.etoricoxib.midamor&quot;&gt;claritin bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt;  Then it was time for Bruckner&amp;rsquo;s Eighth, a piece so vast you really have to stand back to see its huge outlines. One can&amp;rsquo;t do that in music, unfortunately, but conductor Lorin Maazel offered the next best thing, which was to make the tempo proportions really clear. Maazel is such a brilliant technician, and the Vienna Philharmonic so used to handling and rounding-off Bruckner&amp;rsquo;s great blocks of sound that the whole thing seemed almost easy. And that was a problem. Yes, the sound was as rich-grained as one would expect, and the sound of four of those special Viennese deep-bore horns and Wagner tubas was a sound to die for. But where was the urgency in the big cello melody of the slow movement? Without an enlivening human touch, Bruckner&amp;rsquo;s big paragraphs can seem magnificent, but inert.
