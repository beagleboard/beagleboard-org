In 2010 former Georgia wide receiver A.J. Green was suspended four games by the NCAA for selling his 2009 Independence Bowl jersey for $1,000. In 2004, former Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith -- who would go on to win the Heisman Trophy two years later -- was suspended for two games for accepting $500 from a Buckeyes booster. In the most prominent and widest recent example, six Ohio State players were suspended for part of the 2011 or 2012 seasons for selling memorabilia or exchanging it for benefits such as tattoos.

It can&amp;#8217;t legally get away with offering phony sales numbers in its quarterly report, so instead it&amp;#8217;s holding back the numbers and instead offering carefully worded misleading statements. Parse them and you&amp;#8217;ll see how AT&amp;T&amp;#8217;s lawyers gave it an back door to the wording so that the claims about the majority of its smartphone sales being Android aren&amp;#8217;t technically a lie, even if they are one in function. Why is AT&amp;T trying so hard to pretend that its iPhone sales are falling off? For the same reason AT&amp;T has been promoting Android with a vengeance since 2011.
