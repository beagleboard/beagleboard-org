Since it was first shown on UK screens less than two years ago, the show has garnered an array of awards, including Golden Globes and Emmys for Lewis, 42, and his co-star, 34-year-old Danes. At tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s Emmy awards in Los Angeles, it has been nominated for eight more awards. It has also earned a devoted fan base across the world, from Australia to Argentina, Iraq to Israel &amp;ndash; where the drama Hatufim, on which Homeland&amp;rsquo;s first series was based, originated &amp;ndash; for its deft plot twists, psychological drama and clear contemporary resonance in an age of widespread paranoia.
