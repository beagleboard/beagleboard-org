It was such a refreshing sound on a stiflingly hot day. At one point, the chirping grew louder and louder, and my curiosity led me into one alley. There, I found countless little insects in bird cages and small jars on sale and waiting for their new owners.

I was far beyond any fear. I was going to the slaughterhouse. I was dreaming of some way to escape but knew that Mabrouka was lying in ambush behind the door. I remained motionless, so he leaped to his feet and with a force that took me by surprise he grabbed my arm, threw me on the bed, and flung himself on top of me.

He shouted, &apos;Don&apos;t move, you dirty whore!&apos; He beat me, crushed my breasts, and then after pulling up my dress and pinning my arms down, he brutally penetrated me.&quot;

How many times is any tournament shootout, let alone a major, decided on the eighth and ninth holes? Thatâs where Dufner took a two-shot lead on Furyk, never to give it back.
