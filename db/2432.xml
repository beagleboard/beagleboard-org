    <body>We need someone with qualifications &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?indinavir.mellaril.levitra.cephalexin&quot;&gt;picamilon ban uk&lt;/a&gt;  Microsoft has cited inventory management as one of its biggest reasons for limiting routes to market for Surface. The complexities of stocking hardware and managing returns are significantly different from the issues faced around selling software, whether boxed or sold by license. But Microsoft isnât handling those logistics exclusively itself â in fact, in most geographies, the companyâs distribution partners have inventory of the Surface. Theyâre just being limited in to whom they can sell the tablet. Those distributors, of course, provide exactly the kind of logistics abilities and experience that Microsoft seems to be seeking to develop around Surface. And for their part, they seem to be champing at the bit to get Surface into the broader channel community.
