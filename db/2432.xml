We depend on lots of infrastructure that we don&amp;#8217;t think about much unless it starts working badly or abuses us: road and transportation systems, water and power utilities, communications and information networks, payment systems, food and clothing providers, to name a few.

Power right wing Rick Nash was a force in his first season (42 points, 21 goals) but had a disappointing playoffs (one goal, four assists). Richards will start the season opposite Nash on the left wing of Stepan, an experiment that could go right or wrong. Rounding out the group are veteran Taylor Pyatt , Norwegian playmaker Mats Zuccarello , and grit guys Derek Dorsett and Arron Asham .

Brady, who was sacked five times, was skittish from start to finish that night.
