    <body>Where do you live? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/stmap_0a7b0.html?isosorbide.amiodarone.diarex.levitra&quot;&gt;labpe.com&lt;/a&gt;  Americans had lived in a pervasive culture of pure selfish gains since 2000. People, private enterprise and governments even plunged into unfathomable debt to keep up the good times. With a population of 320 million, you&amp;#8217;d think there is enough wisdom, enough check and balance, and enough well-educated to self-sustain prosperity. But these have also been squandered. Everything, the whole country, lived for the moment, for instant gratification. The wealthy wanted and got ever less taxed. The less fortunate wanted and got ever more welfare. The military wanted and got ever bigger budget and world&amp;#8217;s most expensive armament. Nationally, spending hit beyond 100% and saving hit negative. All for the good times of the moment.
