In the 1970s, Hochmair and Clark of the cochlear implant company MED-EL in Innsbruck, Austria, and the University of Melbourne, respectively, were the first to insert multiple electrodes into the human cochlea to stimulate nerves that respond to different frequencies of sound. Wilson, now at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, later refined the technology with a strategy known as âcontinuous interleaved samplingâ (CIS), which allowed the implants to process speech clearly. CIS continues to be the most effective way to translate acoustic information into electrical signals that the brain can interpret, says otolaryngologist Debara Tucci, who with Wilson co-directs the Duke Hearing Center. Before modern implants, âpatients were really terrifiedâ at the prospect of deafness, she says. These contributions have âchanged the lives of thousands and thousands of people for the better.â
