It has proven to be a problem for some F-35 pilots. In February 2013, the Pentagonâs chief weapons tester, Dr. Gilmore, reported that the cockpit design impedes pilotsâ ability to see their âsix oâclockââthat is, directly behind them. According to Gilmore, who collected the bulk of his data down at Eglin, one air-force pilot reported on his evaluation form that lack of aft visibility in the F-35 âwill get the pilot gunned [down] every time.â What is more, the distributed aperture system, which is supposed to compensate for structural impediments to visibility, itself has blind spots, which, according to Charlie and others, preclude its use during airborne refueling.
