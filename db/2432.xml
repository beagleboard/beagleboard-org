    <body>Thanks for calling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/kosten-motilium-9e88.pdf&quot;&gt;faut il une ordonnance pour du motilium&lt;/a&gt;  Mohammed Shaikhibrahim, euronews: &amp;#8220;The Egyptian forces order are mopping up, clearing the area. We&amp;#8217;re still hearing firing from both sides, between Muslim Brotherhood members and the forces of order. Real bullets are being used. Witnesses are saying that the first shots came from the square itself, so from the Muslim Brotherhood, and that the forces of order were obliged to retaliate. The result is a high number of dead and wounded.&amp;#8221;

They sought to have the prosecutors disqualified over the incident.

Intel and Microsoft have big problems. For the last 8 years, at least, I have heard the INTEL CEO coming with same presentation. Market is bad. We believe it is weakening and probably we will have to review the forecast. And then they come with better number but lowering future forecasts. Very bad managed.No creativity nor motivation. Microsoft is almost the same. They have the worst CEO I have ever seen at tech group. This guy is horrible. If they do not change they will go nowhere. But we all know that a 9 pct. drop is something not acceptable and is a good opportunity to buy.
