Loeb paid much less for those shares when he started buying them in August 2011 and the shares were trading hands for some $13. Loebâs average costs basis for his entire stake in Yahoo is about $13.50 a share. Yahoo is repurchasing Loebâs stock for $29.11 a share, the closing price of Yahooâs stock on Friday, meaning the stock has returned 124% since Loeb has been involved in the stock. In the end, Loebâs investment in Yahoo has more than doubled and his hedge fund, which also sold some Yahoo shares earlier this year, has made about $1 billion on Yahoo in less than two years.
