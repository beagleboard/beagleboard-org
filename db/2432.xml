    <body>Yes, I play the guitar &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/taking-prescription-drugs-to-america-92e2.pdf&quot;&gt;top 100 generic drugs 2014&lt;/a&gt;  Peter Galsworthy, HSE head of operations in the West Midlands, said: &quot;We have concluded our investigation into the death of Gillian Astbury at Stafford Hospital and have decided there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to bring criminal proceedings in this case. HSE will be charging Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust under Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act. Gillian Astbury died on April 11 2007, of diabetic ketoacidosis, when she was an inpatient at the hospital. The immediate cause of death was the failure to administer insulin to a known diabetic patient. Our case alleges that the trust failed to devise, implement or properly manage structured and effective systems of communication for sharing patient information, including in relation to shift handovers and record-keeping.&quot;
