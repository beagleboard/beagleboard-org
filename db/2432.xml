Counting background levels is only part of the story. People who live there will be eating contaminated food and water so their internal exposures will be beyond background levels and cumulative. Isotopes of cesium collect in muscles, strontium collects in bones, and other isotopes also accumulate in tissues, making escape from radiation impossible. While exposure standards for workers only count external exposure, and employees can be taken out of harm&amp;#8217;s way or retired, no such reductions can occur for those living in the contamination. For that reason, setting exposure levels at industry worker levels are too high for health. TEPCO is incompetent in resolving this disaster, they are grasping at straws when after 60 years of atomic power, we should expect them to know how to deal with what they have created. We must prevent this from happening again by phasing out all nuclear power and moving to renewable energy that is truly safe and clean.
