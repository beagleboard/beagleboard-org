    <body>Where do you study? &lt;a href=&quot;https://accentresurfacing.com/amoxicillin-125-mg-dosage-for-infants-4110.pdf#flame&quot;&gt;does amoxicillin 500mg get you high&lt;/a&gt;  Dorner was an admitted serial killer of our Police force. How can you credibly contend the People should be &quot;outraged&quot; that the LAPD didn&apos;t want to see any more civilians or officers killed when they lit it on fire? Like your suggestion the People should have some undue remorse for the likes for al-Awlaki being killed by a drone strike, your propaganda piece conspicuously omits any reference to cost/benefit considerations. Taken to its illogical conclusion, what, the LAPD should risk more lives on account of a suicidal Dorner&apos;s alleged civil rights? The US shouldn&apos;t employ the use of cost-effective drones to hunt down and kill those that take up arms against our Armed Services and, what, invade and occupy Arab sovereigns, i.e., thereby exacerbating the anti-American sentiments and validating the propaganda fed to the poor masses in the Middle East by the Arab ruling elite that it is the US/Israel that is, in the end, the cause of their impoverished plight? Sorry, I don&apos;t buy it. Nor should any rational, measured thinker be &quot;anti-government&quot; or engage in unbecoming distrust of our system of justice on account of one or two cases. There is an old adage: &quot;bad facts make bad law.&quot; The Martin case was, in many respects, like a wrongful death version of the Dead Man Statute in several states, i.e., there is nobody to rebut the testimony of the person asserting the material facts.Â
