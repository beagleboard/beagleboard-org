The couple&apos;s fast-tracked romance &amp;#150; which began just a few short months after Johansson split from husband Ryan Reynolds &amp;#150; has ended, according to People.com. Penn&apos;s relationship with the actress first became public when they dined in Los Angeles on Feb. 28 &amp;#150; with Johansson&apos;s foot resting firmly in his lap.

In his first stint with the &quot;everyday&quot; label, Kratz struggled, batting .191 in 21 games. With Ruiz injured, however, Kratz hit the ball well and was hitting .270 with six homers, 14 RBIs and a .970 OPS in his final 19 games before his own injury.
