    <body>I&apos;ll call back later &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?cialis.fucidin.isoptin&quot;&gt;roy pharmacy roy utah&lt;/a&gt;  And even if they somehow manage that, there will be the really well-hidden drug markets. One of these, operating in the capital of a former Soviet republic, does not use only encryption: It accepts members by invitation only. Nothing is bought or sold on the site itself: Contact is made, money -- the national currency, not Bitcoin -- changes hands through a cash transfer system, then the vendor tells the buyer where the goods are hidden. After the deal, both vendor and buyer have to fill in a detailed questionnaire, telling the site administrator how it went. The data collected from questionnaires goes toward members&apos; ratings. Those with a low rating are banned from the site, which, apart from bringing drug sellers and buyers together, provides a plethora of information about drug varieties and users&apos; experiences with all kinds of substances. The anonymous community counts several hundred members, and it has operated for months without mishap. Eventually, police may infiltrate it, but as long as the administrator, who takes a percentage on the deals, is not too greedy, that prospect is remote.
