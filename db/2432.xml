    <body>I&apos;m not interested in football &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/stmap_9e880.html?clomiphene.amoxicillin.viagra&quot;&gt;lecheek nutrition andro-5a 30 caps&lt;/a&gt;  The parallels &amp;ndash; or lack of them &amp;ndash; between British and US politics are fresh in my mind. A small wave of visitations by Republicans to London has generated some peculiarly lively discussions over dinner tables in Westminster. I have been present at a number of convivial exchanges of transatlantic advice/inspiration/despair between Us and Them which have, as often as not, revealed as much about the differences between the two political cultures as they have about the common problems of Right-of-centre parties in the Anglosphere.
