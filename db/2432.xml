    <body>Other amount &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/use-of-trazodone-in-dogs-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;can a person get high on trazodone&lt;/a&gt;  Knowing Tom Hanks would play the signature role in âCaptain Phillips,â I assumed the movie would be a hit, and it was. It was the kind that becomes an instant classic, similar to Hanksâ âCastaway.â I feel cheesy saying it, but it was one of those that will make you laugh, make you cry and have you on the edge of your seat. When it comes out on DVD, Iâll be purchasing it for sure. While Tom Hanksâ character was amazing, the pirates were the ones who really captured my attention. Each one had a distinct personality, and it really gave the film some heart. Even though they were the bad guys, I couldnât help feeling sorry for them. Good and evil was not a clear-cut relationship in the film, and the piratesâ characterization rounded out the plot.
