Simon Jack speaks to some of those involved including Britain&apos;s finance minister at the time Alistair Darling. He asks Professor Kenneth Rogoff if it was a mistake to let Lehman&apos;s go bust. And Tony Lomas from auditors PWC explains how some people are making lots of money from picking over Lehman&apos;s corpse. Plus Dr Pippa Malmgren, a former financial adviser to President George W Bush, says the situation now is worse than it was then.

The fact that all five days were sold out before Christmas proves it is one of the most popular Test match arenas not only in England, but the world. The last Ashes Test match here in 2009 was played on a result pitch because England had to win. I haven&amp;#039;t seen this surface yet, but I guarantee it will produce good cricket.
