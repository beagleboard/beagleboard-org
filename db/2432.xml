Back in June when Victor Cruz signed his five-year, $43 million contract, the big question was how the Giants were going to be able to afford to sign Nicks, too, especially when everyone around the NFL expected him to seek â and probably get $11 million per year.

But the fact that filing confidentially keeps its competitors from getting an inside look at its operations for several weeks is still quite valuable, since in a fast-moving industry like social media, every day matters. Perhaps even more important, the new rule shortens the amount of time that Twitter will have to deal with the flood of media coverage and investment punditry that its S-1 will provoke. Going public, particularly for a high-profile company, is an incredibly annoying process (which makes it good preparation, perhaps, for the annoyance of being a public company). It&amp;#8217;s a time suck, and it draws employees&amp;#8217; energy and attention away from the business. And this has gotten much worse in today&amp;#8217;s hypersaturated media environment: just look at how many words have already been written about yesterday&amp;#8217;s tweet (which, as of Friday morning, had been retweeted more than thirteen thousand times).
