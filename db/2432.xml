The Irish opted out of their contract with the Wolverines and made next yearâs game in South Bend, Ind., the last guaranteed matchup in a series that dates to 1887 and cancelling three previously scheduled games. Hoke insisted he didnât tell his team that Irish coach Brian Kelly kicked off the week by saying the series was âa big regional gameâ even though it features teams with the top winning percentages in college football. Hoke would acknowledge, though, that he and his players were pretty fired up to face the Irish. âThereâs certain games that you get very excited about,â Hoke said.

Hearing another person&apos;s story secondhand, even if it had a good outcome, didn&apos;t feel like encouragement to Steele. Talking directly to other people with breast cancer, however, can be helpful. &quot;If a friend gave me a survivor&apos;s contact information, that was beneficial,&quot; says Steele, who could follow up with a call when she felt like it.
