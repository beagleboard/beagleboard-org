Theyâve abandoned it in droves, and news reports indicate that NBC Universal management has noticed all that and is considering a shake-up. The investor class is under assault in the U.S. to a degree that none of us have seen in our lifetimes. They donât want the optimism case. They donât want the pessimism case. They donât want the members of the ruling class who are assaulting their portfolios to be coddled rhetorically by someone who is supposed to be on their side. They want the truth, and the truth is that free-market capitalism IS the best path to prosperity, but that it IS NOT the path we are currently on. Letâs save the optimism for the time when we get our feet back on the proper path.
