He got it fixed in Oklahoma City, and we came back. And the prettiest girl ... Leslie Carter was this homecoming queen, cheerleader, whatever she was, and she never said boo to us. Rex is walking with his crutch and heâs got his cast on. She goes, âOh, Rex, I feel so sorry for you.

She does speak.â And heâs like, âAbout six weeks.â About that time, he takes one step and hits this curtain. He trips and falls literally on his face. He looks back and says, âMake that eight weeks.â
