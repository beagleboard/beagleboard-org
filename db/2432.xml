It&apos;s the the role that Amaro hoped Delmon Young could fill on the cheap; when he couldn&apos;t, Young was mercifully designated for assignment on Aug. 9 after hitting .261 with eight homers in 80 games. Ruf has 10 homers in 40 games.

The Strengthening the Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act directs the Department of Health and Human Services to create guidelines that assist child welfare agencies.
