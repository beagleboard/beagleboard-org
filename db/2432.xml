Â I believe that Roy Hibbert should be able to match up well against anyone in the post, and actually have the advantage over most centers. With Greg Oden, I feel like those injuries had to take a toll on him, and the fact that he&amp;#8217;s not played in four seasons. It&amp;#8217;s hard to see him matching up well with Hibbert if Hibbert has his confidence in that right place. Â That&amp;#8217;s the biggest deal with Roy Hibbert, it&amp;#8217;s all about that head. Â If he&amp;#8217;s on his game and looking confident, good things happen. I don&amp;#8217;t even know if we&amp;#8217;ll see the Oden-Hibbert match up because I feel like the Heat are going to be very cautious with Oden because they don&amp;#8217;t need to play him that much anyways. Â He could get some minutes once he proves he&amp;#8217;s ready to go, but even then, I question how much he will end up playing.
