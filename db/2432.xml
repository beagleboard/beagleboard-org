Viewers around the country got an eyeful when Minaj&apos;s left nipple popped out during her performance on ABC&apos;s &apos;Good Morning America.&apos; The Queens native, known for her eccentric outfits, was rocking a neon-pink vinyl jacket over a barely-there sky-blue tank-top when - oops! - her nipple made a cameo.
