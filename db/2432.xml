    <body>My battery&apos;s about to run out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/celebrex-price-rite-aid-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;celebrex rite aid&lt;/a&gt;  Luckily, the neighbouring houses could be spared. But the famous concert location was completely destroyed, only the outer walls of the building remain. Merely two people were injured during the fire: a firemen broke his wrist and an actor suffered from smoke poisoning. At the time of the outbreak of the fire, hardly anyone was at the festival site. Two hours later, a concert was meant to take place. The organisers expected about 700 guests.
