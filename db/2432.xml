    <body>We&apos;d like to invite you for an interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://accentresurfacing.com/norvasc-cheap-4110.pdf#item&quot;&gt;telmisartan amlodipine&lt;/a&gt;  I am chatting to Nihal off Radio 1 about how ridiculous all the Googleites look in their Google Glass. &quot;Do you wanna try a pair?&quot;, he asks, and before I know it he has thrown a smile the way of the relevant PR person and I&amp;rsquo;m having my first Google Glass experience. It&amp;rsquo;s disconcerting. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at Nihal, yet also at an image of Big Ben. As with the current crop of smartwatches, I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be four or five years before this kind of wearable tech is a truly mainstream product. But I can&amp;rsquo;t help but be a little bit excited. I have my photo taken wearing them. I don&amp;rsquo;t look ridiculous, at all.

Much of the rest owes more to Miranda&amp;rsquo;s favourite ancestor, the fifth earl (1684-1700) who &amp;ldquo;went shopping&amp;rdquo; in Europe on a prototypical Grand Tour, buying and commissioning many of Burghley&amp;rsquo;s greatest treasures.
