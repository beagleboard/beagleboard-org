Star players werenât treated like star players. Rookies and fourth-liners werenât treated like that. Everybody was treated equal. . . . Over time, that built accountability within ourselves, and we were able to kind of take the team over. . . . We had a lot of meetings with ourselves in this dressing room without coaching staff.â
