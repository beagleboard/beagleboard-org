    <body>Did you go to university? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/stmap_e3c40.html?vepesid.macrobid.cialis&quot;&gt;viagra 5 mg&lt;/a&gt;  One of the best investments with a guaranteed return has been Super Bowl tickets for those able to secure them at face value. Tickets have been going for two or three times face value on the secondary market, and the face value will be higher for some tickets for the New York Super Bowl, especially the 9,000 club seats that will be priced at $2,500 per ticket. Hereâs the issue: Is the NFL entitled to increase the face value based on what fans are willing to pay on the secondary market? Should the league benefit financially from the tremendous value of the tickets or should the fans who buy them at face value get to cash in? Basically, the answer is whatever the market will bear. If fans are willing to pay over $1,000 per ticket at face value, that probably means other fans are willing to pay twice that much on the secondary market. The NFL says 40% of the general admission tickets for Super Bowl XLVIII will be priced under $1,000. The most expensive non-club seats will be $1,500. The players get 45% of the Super Bowl ticket revenue. It will be interesting to see how much fans will be willing to pay on the secondary market for Super Bowl XLVIII, the first one played in an outdoor cold weather city.
