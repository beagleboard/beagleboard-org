She&apos;s in fairly good health, she&apos;s got a great sense of humor, and she&apos;s capable of walking long distances without tiring. Unlike so many of her friends, I&apos;ve never heard her complain about swollen ankles or back pain. When my grandfather was alive, the two of them would go on walks together. She&apos;d also sit in the car while he took her on drives, and the two of them would often go shopping.
