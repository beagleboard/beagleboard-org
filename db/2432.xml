Mobile devices have almost no tolerance for poor judgement when it comes to design or implementation. Users are less tolerant of touch latency, poor design decisions and other foibles, even if they canât articulate it. The stakes are higher now and the gap that Google shot in the early days of this mobile age has closed. Android skated by as the only viable alternative early on, and Microsoft arguably produced a more polished and unique first product with Windows Phone. But it was very late, all things considered, and itâs been playing catch-up ever since.
