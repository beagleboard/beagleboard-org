Generally, pilots will turn on the &quot;autothrottle,&quot; and will use one of their several autopilots to set the speed. The plane, in theory, will then automatically adjust the throttle to make sure the speed is constant on the approach. Of course, the autopilots can&apos;t violate the laws of physics. Pilots themselves have to make sure the plane is within a certain set of physical parameters in order for the autopilot to work properly. Some pilots like to manually adjust the throttle to maintain the speed; some don&apos;t. And right before landing, the autopilot has to be disengaged because the plane is supposed to touch down and then slow down, something it can&apos;t do if the plane itself wants to keep the speed constant. (Some autopilot automatically disengage at a certain height). For all the talk of how &quot;planes land themselves,&quot; pilots are the ones who decide when to disengage the autopilot and when to retard the throttle to idle, and how and when to begin the &quot;flare&quot; -- which is that nose-up maneuver that both increases drag, slows down the plane, and allows the aircraft to touch down on its rear wheels as gently as possible. (Some planes CAN land themselves; these &quot;category 3 ILS approaches&quot; are still kind of rare, because airports have to be certified for them, pilots have to be trained extensively for them, and a lot of people still can&apos;t get over the idea of letting a plane decide when to cut off the autothrottle and automatically pitch up.)

The two Democratic commissioners - Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman, and Julie Brill - voted for it. Of the two Republicans, Joshua Wright voted against it and Maureen Ohlhausen was recused.

Morgan named Ben Sayer was all smiles: The head of a rapidly expanding hedge fund said to have almost $200 million in assetsâone Anthony Davian of Davian Capital Advisorsâhad invited him to attend his fundâs annual golf outing for clients at the swanky Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio. And this meant, to Sayer at least, that he might be on the verge of snagging a job offer at Davianâs Akron-based fund.

These are my true feelings and my form of expression about it.&quot;
