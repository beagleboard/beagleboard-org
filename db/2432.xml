Itâs already made headway in at least 16 countries, including the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Argentina, and Fiji, the BBC reports.

Last Saturday, on an afternoon when temperatures topped off at 115 degrees on the field in Memphis and the visiting locker roomâs air conditioning conveniently shut down, Cutcliffeâs starting quarterback, Anthony Boone, broke his collarbone in the second quarter. The Blue Devils managed to win and improve to 2-0 heading into Saturdayâs game against Georgia Tech, but Boone spent the last week learning how to sleep in a recliner so as to limit motion related to his clavicle. Redshirt junior Brandon Connette assumed the position under center. Cutcliffe assigned Connette the nickname âPhantomâ for his ability to play any number of roles, lining up everywhere from tight end to Wildcat to wide receiver and beyond.

Iâve never seen the play. That was pretty funny. But just to get that ball up in the air into center field and (then) the other way, to me those are good signs. I donât know if thereâs such a thing as a big hit, but just getting the ball in the air, whether he caught that or if it was a double, itâs a good thing.â
