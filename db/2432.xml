Don&apos;t use your coupons right away. Jill Cataldo, consumer coupon expert and founder of Super-Couponing, says clipping coupons from Sunday newspaper inserts and shopping with them that same week is a waste of time. &quot;Stores know weeks ahead of time what product coupons are coming out in the inserts, and they may leave the corresponding products at higher prices intentionally,&quot; Cataldo says. To get the most value out of your coupons, hold on to them until your supermarket drops its prices. Cataldo says the lowest sale prices at supermarkets and drugstores occur one week every three months. If you have coupons in hand, that week would be the ideal time to stock up on sale items for a few weeks or months.
