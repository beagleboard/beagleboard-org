To parents and teens, Facebook is claiming they are giving them more options to protect their privacy. But in reality, they are making a teen&apos;s information more accessible, now that they have the option to post publicly,&quot; said Jeffrey Chester, executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy. &quot;Today&apos;s announcement actually removes a safeguard that teens currently have, that they only can expose (share) their posts with friends of friends. Under Facebook&apos;s new plan, a teen can share their information with anyone on Facebook or the Internet.&quot;
