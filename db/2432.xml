Dell may decide to delay thevote to gain time to win support for the deal, a person familiarwith the matter said earlier on Tuesday.

And hurricane-watching won&apos;t be confined just to communities along the coast. We&apos;ll all need to pay attention.

Itâs a great camera with speedy autofocus and a beautiful file. We also have a D800 which offers a bigger file but doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to do quite as well with autofocus speed and accuracy, which proved critical for this shoot as some of the animals like to move around. Many are also very small which required macro equipment and the resulting focus tolerances are very narrow, even at the high apertures I was using and again rendering autofocus accuracy critical. For the first animal &amp;#8212; an 8-10â Henkel&amp;#8217;s leaf-tailed gecko (Uroplatus henkeli) &amp;#8212; I was able to use a 70-200mm lens but for all the others I reverted to a 50mm 1.4 coupled with my personal Canon 250D closeup lens. While not ideal for this sort of work, the combination did just fine.
