    <body>Thanks funny site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?vrikshamla.actos.levitra&quot;&gt;amoxicillin rx child&lt;/a&gt;  If a US/Western powers attack against Syria is launched, it will not be because Syrian forces (assuming they did) employed chemical weapons. It will be because the employment of those weapons gives the US/Western powers an excuse to implement the desired policy to effect regime change in Syria. For the Administration to state the strike will not affect the balance of power between the Syrian government and rebel forces is simply a lie, as fixed and rotary wing aircraft, artillery, rocket launchers, and other means of delivering chemical weapons will be targeted. Those are the same capabilities that enable the Syrian government to maintain its tactical edge against the rebels. Secondly, any US/Western attack against Syrian forces will divert the attention of those forces and enable rebel forces to make territorial gains.
