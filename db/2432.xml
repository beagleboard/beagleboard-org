Public sector banking groups, such as RBS, are excluded from the primary measure of net public debt used by the government and the Office for Budget Responsibility. However, like the existing state run UK Asset Resolution, the bad bank will most likely be included on the exchequer&apos;s balance sheet, and thus be included in the public debt. The government may have limited appetite to see an increase in the debt level, so this would likely be a constraint for the size of a potential bad bank asset pool.
