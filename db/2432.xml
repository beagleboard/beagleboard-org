My eyes were opened to design, to fashion, to art and architecture. I appreciated beauty and discovered taste.

We&apos;re just not sure it makes sense for a 15-inch notebook. While the smaller Flip 13 and Flip 14 look promising, the 15 is bulky for a convertible, and is awkward to use in tablet mode, even when it&apos;s resting in your lap. Really, we can&apos;t think of a reason to go with this screen size unless you want that higher-resolution 2,880 x 1,620 display option or discrete graphics. Otherwise, even if money is an issue, the 14-inch model starts at $50 less, and is obviously more portable. Regardless of which size you choose (if you go with the Flip at all), we suggest you wait until Sony issues a firmware update or two: it&apos;s clearly got some early performance kinks to iron out.
