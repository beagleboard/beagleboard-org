    <body>I&apos;d like to pay this in, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/prescription-drugs-database-download-5553.pdf#den&quot;&gt;best drugstore makeup of 2014&lt;/a&gt;  Williams and Bucs have spent a good amount of time trying to hash this out during the offseason so its good to see this taken care of. The deal ensures that the team&apos;s receiving nucleus (Williams and Vincent Jackson) will remain intact for the foreseeable future, with Williams coming off a solid 63-catch, nine-TD campaign in 2012 that saw him fall just shy (996) of joining the ranks of the NFL&apos;s 1,000-yard wideouts. While Jackson remains the team&apos;s top option at wideout, Williams&apos; red zone ability, along with the Bucs&apos; lack of proven receiver depth and pass-catching tight ends, should leave him with plenty of opportunities in his fourth season.
