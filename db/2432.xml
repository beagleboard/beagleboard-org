With the paparazzi ready to snap their every move, you would think that celebrities would be...

Noting that New Yorkers had grown used to having big personalities in City Hall, Remnick suggested that de Blasio had expressed &amp;#8220;derision&amp;#8221; for the foghorn approach to the mayoralty adopted by Koch, Giuliani, and Bloomberg. In response, de Blasio pointed out that he had praised parts of the Koch and Bloomberg legacy. (He conceded that he couldn&amp;#8217;t find much that was nice to say about Giuliani.) Then he went on:

The new discovery offers a way of improving that efficiency even more: by applying the relevant charge to a nearby metal plate, jumping droplets can be yanked away from the surface, lowering the chance of their being pushed back onto the condenser by gravity or by the drag generated by the flow of the surrounding vapor toward the surface.
