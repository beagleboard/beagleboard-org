    <body>I&apos;d like to send this letter by  &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/stmap_83f50.html?prevacid.savitra.viagra.zantac&quot;&gt;zantac tablets price in pakistan&lt;/a&gt;  Thank you, Raimo. I will start with that and then ask Carl to chime in on the ELAs. Overall, just as we get started, I just want to reemphasize again how proud we are of the balanced performance across the company products, marketing and then balanced execution across all the geos. And as I said in my formal remarks, Raimo, we see VMware as whatâs uniquely positioned to help transition customers through this mobile cloud era of computing over enabling IT to liberate resources from todayâs client server environments saving them money so they can invest in the future. In particular, coming off of VMworld, we just saw extraordinary response to the overall software-defined data center vision and strategy and this is resonating powerfully with customers really increasing the strategic relationship that we are building with them is clearly seen by our ELA performance. Carl?
