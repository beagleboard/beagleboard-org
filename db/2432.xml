    <body>I never went to university &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/does-rogaine-foam-cause-hair-loss-e3c4.pdf&quot;&gt;rogaine to grow chest hair&lt;/a&gt;  I have met well-meaning men &amp;ndash; and too few women &amp;ndash; in boardrooms across London and New York who complain about widespread ignorance of shipping. They want a better public image for an industry that in Britain alone employs 634,900 people, contributes £8.45 billion in tax and generates two per cent of the national economy, more than restaurants, take-away food and civil engineering combined, and only just behind the construction industry. They despair that shipping only emerges with drama and disaster: a cruise ship sinking, or another oil spill and blackened birds. They would like people to know such names as the Wec Vermeer, arrived from Leixões and heading for Rotterdam, not just Exxon Valdez and Titanic. They provide statistics showing how the dark days of oil spills are over. Between 1972 and 1981, there were 223 spills. Over the past decade, there were 63. Each year, a publicist told me, &apos;more oil is poured down the drain by car mechanics changing engine oil than is spilt by the world&amp;rsquo;s fleet of oil tankers&amp;rsquo;.
