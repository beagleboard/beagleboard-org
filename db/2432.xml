    <body>I really like swimming &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?levitra.adapalene.leflunomide.famotidine&quot;&gt;does lemon essential oil contain limonene&lt;/a&gt;  If you apply sunscreen correctly (see question 3), SPF 50 offers the maximum protection necessary. You&apos;re seeing SPF 80 and even SPF 110 on shelves because of &quot;marketing, marketing, marketing,&quot; says Bruce Katz, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. Companies know that higher numbers make you think you&apos;re getting a significant surplus of protection, even though you&apos;re not. But the FDA has caught on to this strategy and proposed a rule making &quot;50 &quot; the highest SPF value allowed. The rule hasn&apos;t been approved yet, but many manufacturers are probably betting it willâthey&apos;re already distributing products labeled SPF 50 , even as they continue to sell higher numbers.
