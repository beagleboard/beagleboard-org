    <body>Please wait &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/christie-brinkley-recapture-360-night-cream-6865.pdf&quot;&gt;christie brinkley recapture 360 night&lt;/a&gt;  Rivera did joke Thursday that with all the loot he has accumulated during the season-long send-off tributes, he may reconsider retirement. &quot;All these gifts that I have I like it. I&apos;m going to go to the National League and I&apos;m going to do another year and then wrap it up,&quot; said Rivera. &quot;I think that&apos;s a good idea but I have to get a different number.&quot; Rivera&apos;s No. 42 â the same number worn by Jackie Robinson â was retired at the Stadium Sunday, when the team held a lavish pre-game ceremony in Rivera&apos;s honor. In addition to having his number retired in Monument Park and all the gifts bestowed on him, Rivera entered the field from the center field bullpen as heavy metal band Metallica played a live version of &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; on a stage on the warning track. The signature song has been Rivera&apos;s entrance music since 1999 when he comes in to pitch during home games.
