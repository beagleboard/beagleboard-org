Otherwise the 114th Congress will be no better than the 113th.

There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of me that can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel smug when a male friend tells me he&amp;rsquo;s cheating on his girlfriend &amp;ndash; smug that I&amp;rsquo;m not in her shoes (which is ridiculous because I&amp;rsquo;ve been in her shoes plenty of times. It&amp;rsquo;s also unkind).

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/neurontin-price-list-a511.pdf&quot;&gt;what is neurontin 600 mg used for&lt;/a&gt;  This comment is for those who will inevitably post that this trial is only the result of public outrage, and the policeâs initial âinvestigationâ is proof no crime was committed. I invite those people to consider the case of Justin Collison, which happened only a few months before Trayvon was killed. Justin is the white son of a Sanford police officer who clearly sucker punches a black homeless man [1]. Despite the overwhelming number of eye witnesses and video evidence that clearly implicates Justin of assault, the initial âpolice investigationâ concluded Justin was innocent of any wrongdoing and let him go. In fact, Justin would never have been charged of a crime without a similar outpouring of community outrage we see now. So no, the Sanford policeâs unilateral exoneration of a well-connected white suspect for a crime with a black victim is not evidence of that suspectâs innocence.
