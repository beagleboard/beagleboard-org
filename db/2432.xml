    <body>How do you know each other? &lt;a href=&quot;https://paradiseinmexico.com.mx/methotrexate-injection-juvenile-arthritis-c13c.pdf#icicle&quot;&gt;methotrexate injection juvenile arthritis&lt;/a&gt;  When Mudasiru arrived, the government-funded ward was out of Coartem, and the study ward was not accepting patients. The doctor could only refer the boy to a private clinic, where Katusime and her husband, peasant farmers who grow sweet potatoes and cassava, would have to pay for his medicine. To cover the $200 cost of her sonâs treatment, Katusime would have to borrow money from a collective in her village. She had to bring the gravely ill Mudasiru back to her home for the weekend while she raised the necessary money and waited for the private clinic to reopen.
