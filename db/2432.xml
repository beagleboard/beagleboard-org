That question was first asked about a year ago, when the probe first started seeing a drop-off in the levels of energetic particles emitted by the Sun, accompanied by a rise in cosmic rays from interstellar space. But the models of the Solar System&apos;s edge had suggested that there should be a corresponding change in the magnetic field&apos;s orientation as the Sun&apos;s field is overwhelmed by that of the galaxy as a whole. And Voyager 1 is seeing nothing of the sort; even as particle levels flip-flopped several times, the magnetic field remained largely stable.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://starbizzcon.com/full-throttle-on-demand-breast-success-reviews-45db.pdf#clause&quot;&gt;full throttle on demand in stores&lt;/a&gt;  (Minneapolis, MN) -- Josmil Pinto singled in the winning run in the bottom of the 11th inning to lift the Twins past the Tigers 4-3 in the opener of a three-game series at Target Field. Brian Dozier hit a game-tying solo homer in the bottom of the ninth for the Twins, who snapped a four-game losing streak. Eduardo Escobar and Ryan Doumit doubled in a run each in the victory. Anthony Swarzak picked up the win. Torii Hunter, Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez drove in a run each for the Tigers, whose magic number to clinch their third straight AL Central Division title remains at two. Luke Putkonen suffered the loss.
