Authorities condemned the home and declared Bush dead, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

The soul here is the bar, and a satisfying meal can be made of the snacks there starting with tiny sliders of buttery braised rabbit and tart, pickled fennel ($7). They would be sublime, save for their dry buns, which taste as if they had been contracted out to the lowest bidder. A sandwich this good deserves better bread. A clever, eye-catching mash-up marries cool scoops of âdeviledâ steak tartare ($8) nested inside boiled egg whites. They make unconventional perfect sense.

They concluded that the best sex they had observed was that between gay and lesbian couples who &amp;ldquo;took their time&amp;rdquo;, and took pleasure in their partner&amp;rsquo;s responses, which &amp;ldquo;goal-orientated&amp;rdquo; heterosexuals rarely did; and they debunked the idea of homosexuality as a mental illness. Yet at the same time they suggested that some people become homosexual because they are emotionally and socially stunted, and they reported &amp;ldquo;curing&amp;rdquo; 67 homosexual men and women with a specially designed &amp;ldquo;conversion therapy&amp;rdquo;. Supported with phoney case studies, the book&amp;rsquo;s findings were quickly denounced by the medical establishment.
