Hunter Walk, an entrepreneur who recently co-founded an early-phase venture firm called Homebrew, told me about a startup where he&amp;#8217;d previously worked. The company had needed to figure out whether to spend its limited budget on beef jerky to keep around the office or 401k plans for the staff. &amp;#8220;We put it to a vote: &amp;#8216;Do you want a 401k or jerky?&amp;#8217;Â &amp;#8221; he explained. &amp;#8220;The vote was unanimously for jerky. The thought was that well-fed developers could create value better than the stock market.&amp;#8221;
