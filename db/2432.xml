We were both at a restaurant having lunch on vacation. I said to Regina, âOh, this is hilarious, Iâm gonna make Oprah buy us lunch,ââ Letterman told Jon Stewart in 2010.Â The television titans made amends in 2005, ending the 16-year face-off, when Winfrey went on the late-night show and Letterman apologized.Â
