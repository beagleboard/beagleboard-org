What I will say is this: I love all the things I guess you are trying to insinuate that Conservatives do, but I THINK for myself. I don&apos;t let some talking head like this LaPew guy tell me what to do or think. I have a concealed handgun license and I own a gun. However, I don&apos;t feel empowered by it or feel it makes me an American. I don&apos;t go off spouting off its MY RIGHT to own one, because everyone shouldn&apos;t own a gun. I&apos;m an American because I was born right here in the good old U.S. of A. PERIOD. I have EVERY right to disagree with someone&apos;s asinine statements. Do you think that a teenager with raging hormones should have a gun?? If you do then you are a crazy as LaPew! You people make me sick with this fake patriotism. A patriot would know that allowing someone to have their own opinion is being a patriot.
