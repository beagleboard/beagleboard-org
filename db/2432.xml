The US and Turkey reportedly want the KNC to be represented by the main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, which it joined in September 2013. The PYD meanwhile wants Kurds to be represented by the Kurdish Supreme Committee. And Mr Barzani is said to want the KNC to represent itself.

I think we&apos;ll attract the traditional diesel guys, the guys that love the durability, capability and image that comes with a diesel, and have moved up to 2500 trucks, but might be better-served with a lighter-duty truck. We&apos;ll get those customers that want a diesel at a little lower price point than the HDs. I think we&apos;ll also draw customers that once owned a truck, and loved the utility of a truck, but moved away from the segment for fuel economy reasons. But they&apos;ve never stopped wanting a full-size pickup truck. We&apos;ll get them back with a product that offers around the same fuel economy of what they went to, with all the utility of a truck. I think we&apos;ll get a lot of people back into the truck market,&quot; he said.
