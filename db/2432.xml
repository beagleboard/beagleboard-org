In 2004, Kidd, the Netsâ star at the time, reportedly urged the music mogul to buy into the team. Jay Z was integral in building the brand, serving as the franchise figurehead and connection to Brooklyn as the team moved from New Jersey. He also was a bridge to stars, participating in failed meetings with free agents LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony.

The service willbe contracted to an outside organisation, to be announced in September.

There was hardly any furniture, equipment, or medicine in the many rooms of this two-story facility, which serves a population of 200,000.

Not even beating the greatest player in history for the first time in a Grand Slam match or playing some of the best tennis of his life in a thrilling 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 6-7, 6-2 victory was a cause for celebration. The only thought in Murray&apos;s mind was to preserve his energy in preparation for tomorrow&apos;s final against Novak Djokovic.

(It remains astounding to me that those two companies, founded by very young people nearly 40 years ago, have mattered so much for so long.) But I&amp;#8217;m a fatalist. The dynamics of the tech industry favor new blood, and Microsoft&amp;#8217;s long run at the top wasn&amp;#8217;t so much proof that it was an exception as a hint its time would eventually run out. No matter who was running the joint.
