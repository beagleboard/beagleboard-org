This topic is ridiculous. I&amp;#8217;m of Irish heritage, so we get the drinking, potatoes, and fighting jokes constantly. I have never for one day thought Notre Dames mascot was offensive to my heritage, and Irish folks have been persecuted in their own country, indentured slaves in this country, and negatively stereotyped the world over. No complaints coming from me though, because I have REAL things to worry about in my life without blaming a football franchise for being offensive. Everyone&amp;#8217;s heritage through out history has been thru its ups and downs at the hands of another culture, government, or religion, but never at the hands of a football franchise. Just sayin. C&amp;#8217;mon people. WEAK!

Those CONSERVATIVE Democrats became Republicans, many by way of the Strom Thurmond-led Dixiecrat Party. Then as CONSERVATIVE Republicans they fought to maintain segregation, opposed the Martin Luther King holiday and generally continued their racist ways. Today they fight to limit minority access to the polls.
