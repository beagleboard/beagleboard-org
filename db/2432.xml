Bernstein analysts said in a note.

Apple books revenue when it sells to resellers, who then sell the products to consumers. Sales to consumers - or sell-through - slipped just 4 percent in Greater China from a year ago. By that same measure, mainland Chinese sell-through sales actually rose 5 percent year-on-year, though that was a deceleration in growth, Cook said.

We&apos;re working closely with the NTSB as they conduct their investigation, particularly on this aspect.&quot;

He is not an elite shutdown corner yet, though, as much as he talks of being one. Former defensive coordinator Dick Jauron usually assigned the opponent&apos;s top receiver to Haden. Horton hasn&apos;t said whether he will do that, and whether he does could be determined by whom he chooses to play right cornerback. The position is unsettled; McFadden is a rookie, Skrine has speed but is undisciplined - nine penalties last year - and Owens failed to establish himself as a solid starter in four years in Atlanta. Gipson is in his first year starting, but is big and strong and an upgrade over Usama Young. Offensive coordinators that enjoyed isolating faster receivers on Young won&apos;t have the same success with Gipson. Bademosi adds punch to a secondary that lacks strong hitters after Ward. The Browns allowed 27 touchdown passes last year yet waited until the third round to draft a cornerback (McFadden). The hope is an improved pass rush will make life in the secondary easier.
