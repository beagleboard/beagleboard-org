    <body>I&apos;ve just started at  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/davis-pharmacy-vernal-ut-0a7b.pdf#designed&quot;&gt;davis pharmacy vernal utah&lt;/a&gt;  While here in Washington, the British Chancellor, George Osborne, has met with some of the leading protagonists in the Capitol Hill standoff, including House speaker John Boehner, the US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and Paul Ryan, head of the House Budget Committee, but frankly, there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot outsiders can tell them that they don&amp;rsquo;t already know. They fully appreciate the urgency of the situation.

(Warning: the opening blast threatened the integrity of my eardrums and lasts a good 20 seconds.) At one point I thought a fire alarm had gone off: perhaps it had, but nobody moved.

Those with a shorter duration - which measures a bond&apos;s sensitivity to interest-rate moves - will hold their value better than long-maturity (20 years or more) or junk bond funds. The iShares 1-3 Year Credit Bond ETF, which holds short-term corporate debt, lost only 0.05 percent in the past week and is up 0.47 percent year to date. With this lower risk profile, though, comes a much lower yield of 1.5 percent.
