    <body>I&apos;d like to send this parcel to  &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/lacasahealthcom-3c56.pdf&quot;&gt;firstmed.com.cn&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;It was shocking,&amp;rdquo; said Brian McRae, his former Cubs teammate. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t expect to see your teammates&amp;rsquo; name on the bottom scroll of ESPN saying he drowned at 44 years old. Frank was a quiet guy, didn&amp;rsquo;t say a whole lot. I hung out with him a lot, so I knew him at a different level than some others. He just went about his business and got the most out his ability, spent parts of 13 years in the big leagues and had some success &amp;mdash; a good dude and a good teammate.&amp;rdquo;
