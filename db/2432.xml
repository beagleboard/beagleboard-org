    <body>I can&apos;t get a dialling tone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdesighn.com/generic-viagracom-b26f.pdf#defective&quot;&gt;generic-viagra.com&lt;/a&gt;  I already feel that London is closer to Silicon Valley than New York and anywhere in Europe but it needs a free flow of talent. Not just technology engineers but lawyers, investors and venture capitalists too. Despite improvements in communication it is still very important to bring people together if you want to be creative. Physical proximity is as important as ever. It is a case of attracting the most competent people and for them to come together in one place and create a critical mass. People really should be able to go to a barbecue and come back with a new business idea.
