    <body>Could I take your name and number, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://kssgrp.com/buy-rosuvastatin-online-5457.pdf&quot;&gt;rosuvastatin 10 mg price&lt;/a&gt;  Kamrrem, a Year 10 pupil with the face of an angel and the behavioural instincts of a pitbull was in Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s office within moments. As the son of a white English mother and a Pakistani father, he neatly embodied the ethnic mix in the school which, according to Mitchell, had in 15 years gone from &amp;ldquo;99 per cent white British&amp;rdquo; to being &amp;ldquo;as near as dammit, 50 per cent white British, 50 per cent Asian&amp;rdquo;. The boy also drew attention to the tensions in that community, brandishing claims of racial abuse as his justification for fighting with another boy in the toilets. These accusations were scrutinised by the school with all the rigour of a police investigation and found wanting. It was, Mitchell told us later, the 73rd time that Kamrrem had been sent to his office that year.
