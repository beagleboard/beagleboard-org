Ross is the same judge that awarded a controversial split decision victory to Timothy Bradley against Manny Pacquiao last year when most observers thought Pacquiao did enough to win. In most sports, it&apos;s the best officials who get to referee the most important events, based on their previous performances. But that doesn&apos;t always happen in boxing, said Showtime boxing chief, Stephen Espinoza. No one from the Nevada State Athletic Commission was immediately available for comment after the fight.
