Shadow banks offer loans to small and medium-sized companies that are ignored by large state-run banks. Often, the loans are packaged and sold to investors looking for higher returns.

Venezuela has borrowed some $40 billion from China inrecent years, making the repayments in oil and fuel shipments.

They can make mistakes and beat a pretty good Utah team, but the Cardinal and Ducks won&apos;t be so forgiving. Right tackle Torian White broke his ankle Thursday and will be out for a significant stretch. White&apos;s injury left freshmen Alex Redmond and Caleb Benenoch manning the right side of the line. Mora said center Jake Brendel had to work extra to help the youngsters diagnose defensive fronts. This was especially difficult for Brendel, who then had to put his head down because of UCLA&apos;s silent snap count and fire out of his stance quickly because Utah placed a nose tackle directly over him on most plays. The result? Many of his snaps came out low and to the left, costing the Bruins valuable fractions of a second as Hundley had to work to catch the snap and get himself back in position to throw. The Cardinal and their ferocious pass rush will feast if UCLA doesn&apos;t address that particular problem.
