It is controlled by businessman Chris Hohn, who has been dubbed a âlocustâ in Germany for its investment style. The Financial Times yesterday noted that it was not clear whether TCI intends to pursue an activist strategy at Royal Mail, but based on its record it is unlikely to remain a passive investor. This year, it demanded that EADS, the defence company, sell its 46 percent stake in Dassault Aviation. TCI typically holds stakes in companies for years and expects them to perform. Its clients â including the Â£2-billion charitable foundation it supports â have had returns of 36 percent in the past 10 months alone.
