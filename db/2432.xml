    <body>Could you tell me the number for ? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/erexin-tablet-75b3.pdf&quot;&gt;erexine&lt;/a&gt;  oh and Seattle Sunset .. I take fault in you saying there is no God .. might I ask you .. what gives you the right to say there is no God? oh I forgot the first Amendment.. let me put it this way .. are you sure there is no God? Are you positive?.. did you die and come back to life? to be able to tell us here that there is no God? I think your a moron to say there is no God .. and that is my GOD, notice GOD given right to say that. Our country was founded on religious beliefs.. By our fore fathers.. To say that is your choice but do not tell people there is no God. and I bet you use the God at times when things do not go your way like god damn you kids stay out of my yard.. or God dam I forgot to pay my light bill .. or god dam that person almost hit me with his\her car .. so in my book your the moron here.. I would love to have put you on the front lines and see if you in your infamous way scared out of your wits after you get shot and the medic tells you sorry you not going to make it, I would like to see what you would say then .. Oh there might not be a God but do not take the belief from people and belittle them .. For them to believe in a ultimate being gives them comfort.. And we are not savages, it is mans way of comfort when he meets his end .. And I take fault in you blaming the catholic church also, there are many men of the cloth that have done heinous things to children too.. I get from your post up top that your a troubled individual that has no sense of self worth, you look to incite discontent amongst people, that you try to force your will on people .. but I can tell you this your not going to win with me . I believe in God but I Believe in him my way and no moron like you is going to change my mind.. so you can say all you want .. we can go on and on about this one .. for I love a good argument .. and I never ever lose .. so bring it on .. I stand for what is right and true .. and your wrong and untrue .. I feel sorry for you .. really I do .. but your not going to win .. because you embody the most insensitive thoughts of all human beings .. you think your perfect, well you not .. you never will be and not going to be.. you must have had a troubled child hood.. in fact you might even be that lady that has been trying to take God out of the pledge of allegiance, we were wondering what happened to you.. your a sick individual not really worth the time .. and to think I served this country for people like you to let your kind think you right and not wrong.. tsk tsk .. well I have more important things to do than waste my time with you ..but if you want we can continue this I love a good discussion, so please lets do this. but I must tell you .. your not going to change my mind ok? So HAVE A SUPER GOD BLESSED DAY.. signed, Vietnam Vet
