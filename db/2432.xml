    <body>I stay at home and look after the children &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/sundhed-complete-male-9392.pdf&quot;&gt;sundhed complete male&lt;/a&gt;  Obama previewed his final pitch in his weekly radio and internet speech Saturday. &quot;We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we&apos;ve seen out of Syria,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk that chemical weapons could be used again; that they would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us, and it would send a horrible signal to other nations that there would be no consequences for their use of these weapons. All of which would pose a serious threat to our national security. That&apos;s why we can&apos;t ignore chemical weapons attacks like this one &amp;ndash; even if they happen halfway around the world.&quot;
