    <body>It&apos;s funny goodluck &lt;a href=&quot;https://accentresurfacing.com/wwwashahealthcarecouk-4110.pdf#catching&quot;&gt;panoptes-pharma.com&lt;/a&gt;  First, no news here, Hillary Clinton is best positioned for a Democratic primary for president if she chooses to run. Her score among Democrats is off the charts, and she is the only Democrat tested who has a mean score in the 70s among a likely Democratic base. But she does have vulnerability among Independents in a general election. She ranks fifth among all candidates who are known by more than 50 percent of independents, behind Republicans Christie, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio. This is an area she is going to have to fix if she wants to get elected president and not just be the nominee of her party.
