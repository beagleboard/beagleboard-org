We were able to track the total energy and see where and when it is converted into different kinds of energy.&quot;

They signed Kruger (nine sacks with the Ravens last year) in free agency and used the sixth pick in the draft on Mingo, who totaled 12.5 sacks in two seasons at LSU. They moved Sheard (seven sacks last year) from end to linebacker. Training camp will be about learning to cover running backs and tight ends for Sheard and Mingo. They got a taste of it in OTAs and minicamp, but it will be different in pads and even more different when they face opponents. Jackson annually leads the Browns in tackles. Robertson, an undrafted rookie, is penciled in as the other starting inside linebacker in the 3-4 because the Browns have no one else. They did not add one in free agency nor did they draft an inside linebacker. Robertson&apos;s 83 tackles last year were enough to convince the front office he earned a chance to start. He is quick and plays bigger than his 6-1, 229-pound frame might suggest. Groves played for three teams in five years before signing with the Browns in March. He gives the Browns depth on the outside they did not have last year. He made 41 tackles playing for Ray Horton in Arizona in 2012. Johnson is versatile and can play inside or outside, though the strong side is his natural position. He had a difficult rookie season, missing the first four games with a rib injury and the last two with a knee injury, but he started eight of the 10 games he played and chipped in with 32 tackles. He won&apos;t start, but he will provide depth.
