I have a rather old fashioned view that in politics you do best when you actually set out some positive ideas about what you would do. So, I think that there is a bit of a blank at the moment in what the Labour Party thinks but I am assuming at some point they will get round to telling us about what they would actually do. But what you asked was do I, as a democrat, believe that if the British people say that the most legitimate outcome of the next general election would be a Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition, of course I would be prepared to play my part in that as long as we can get the details right
