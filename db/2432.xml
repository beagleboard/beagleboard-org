If the debt is constantly growing, it can also mean that eventually the borrower will no longer be able to afford to maintain the cards, which can damage his or her ability to take out other forms of credit.

But the secular state still recognized the value of marriage, so they passed laws that required marriage to be a secular state matter. If couples wanted to have a religious ceremony after that, it was up to the couple. But in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, and several other of the European states, unless one is married civilly, one is not married. For most religious people, the civil marriage takes place on one day, and the religious ceremony takes place the next day, as a way of reinforcing the notion that only the Church may witness Holy Matrimony.
