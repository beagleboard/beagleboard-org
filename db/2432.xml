The lawyers also said the âwhistleblowerâ had facts not directly related to the substance of the case.

The services would be overwhelmed. It&amp;rsquo;s no use slapping a label on a child and then not doing anything to help them. My concern is that quick-fix solutions will be sought and, rather than offering the support and help that the family needs as well as treating the child, children will simply be put on medication because it&amp;rsquo;s quick and easy. That must not be the way forward.

Many programs charge a small fee of around $10 a person to participate. The programs usually include a presentation and a nighttime walk to look for turtles. The programs are so popular that they fill up months in advance, with registration usually beginning in April or May for June and July programs. Turtle walks sponsored by the Miami-Dade County Sea Turtle Conservation are offered through September but also fill up well in advance; check back next year for the 2014 schedule at http://www.miamidade.gov/ecoadventures/seaturtle-program.asp.
