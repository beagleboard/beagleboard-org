However, given the growth in CE levels to date and master-lease structure in place, the risk of downgrade due to asset performance deterioration is considered low.For DTC Three and DTC Eight, Fitch continues to believe that these transactions have available cash reserves to address liquidity risk in the absence of an advancing agent. This view is based on the expected stable performance of the loan pools, note amortisation and a low interest rate environment in Japan. Therefore, an unexpected increase in interest rates may lead to negative rating action on these transactions.

One of the scientists involved in the study during his Masters degree, Atte PenttilÃ¤, argues that dung beetles may serve a higher purpose than simply rolling around in the muck. PenttilÃ¤ maintains that a dung beetle&amp;#8217;s propensity towards tunneling through dung deposits may aid in reducing methane emissions. Methane is released under anaerobic conditions, where oxygen is scarce. A foraging beetle exposes much of the cow dung to oxygen and enhances aerobic decomposition, hence, reducing methane production. Theoretically, these beetles could help reduce global warming caused by cattle.
