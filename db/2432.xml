He is already serving 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to helping mastermind one of the biggest hacking fraud schemes in U.S. history, helping steal millions of credit and debit cards.

Tablets began appearing on airplanes almost immediately, first as status symbols, then because, let&apos;s face it, airlines have been squeezing out laptops.

Q3 was a strong quarter for us. We continued our solid performance for all three quarters of 2013. Iâm very pleased with our changed performance and the quarter played largely as we expected. Q3 total revenues grew 14% year-over-year above the midpoint of our guidance range excluding pivotal and divestitures, total revenues grew at an even faster rate of 19% year-over-year.
