But after several stints in rehab, a reformed Osbourne says she feels like the tattoos are now permanent reminders of bad times in her life. In an interview with &apos;Access Hollywood,&apos; Osbourne issued a warning to younger viewers. &apos;Don&amp;#146;t get tattoos, please, because you hate them when you get older,&apos; she said. &apos;I hate them.&apos; Some of Osbourne&apos;s most prominent tats were on display when she modeled at Naomi Cambell&apos;s Fashion for Relief Haiti benefit during New York Fashion Week (above left to right), which include an anchor and a keyboard on her forearms, as well as a pair of angel wings on her back.
