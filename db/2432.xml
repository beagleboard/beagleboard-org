One of the main goals is to help farmers save water and fertilisers, but there are other advantages, as farmer Frank Hausman described: &amp;#8220;A system like this can also help us farmers save time. We can control it via the computer from our office and, that way, we have more time for other things that are equally important to us. I hope the system will be successful. I&amp;#8217;m very surprised at the situation and I&amp;#8217;m happy that we have such good crops.&amp;#8221;

From the FBI: 1993 to 2003 violent crimes fell 43%. From 2003 to 2012 it&amp;#039;s down another 19%. So in two decades violent crimes in the US is down 62%. Meanwhile, on the gaming front, videogames soared to record levels. In the 1980&amp;#039;s home consoles brought in about 600 million dollars. By 1993 it had swollen to almost 10 billion in the US. By 2003 it was hitting 25 million. 2012 it&amp;#039;s a 65 billion dollar industry worldwide. It&amp;#039;s the largest entertainment medium in the world. As the intake of videogames increase, violent crimes decrease. Do videogames decrease crime? Of course not, but there is no way in check you can claim they increase it.
