Makosinski was determined to find a way to power a light without batteries or electricity. &quot;She was my inspiration for the project,&quot; said Makosinski. &quot;So many people have this problem all around the world.

In addressing the Simpson-Bowles plan, he neglects to mention that the plan was dead on arrival when presented in November 2010 because of the implacable opposition of House Republicans, led by Paul Ryan who voted against the plan within the commission. It has long been clear that President Obama is prepared to reach an agreement based on the underlying principles of Simpson-Bowles.
