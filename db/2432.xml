Early on, the spacecraft begins to orbit the Earth. On the last of those orbits, its own on-board propulsion system nudges it into position where it will become subject to the pull of the moonâs gravity.

But such benefits are largely unfunded in the United States, with most states and cities paying as they go. By contrast, public pension funds are between roughly 60 to 73 percent funded on aggregate, depending on how they&apos;re measured.

Because they offer the luxuries of convenience and efficiency. Matthew Mastrogiovanni, a 44-year-old logistics administrator went to an Everest campus in South Plainfield, New Jersey to change his career and get certified in its 9-month electrician program. Mastrogiovanniâs whole family had been to Everest &amp;#8212; his wife completed the Medical Insurance Billing and Coding program, and she only went because she was so impressed with the sales pitch when she brought their son in to register for a pharmacy technician program. For Mastrogiovanni, who works night shifts but wanted a career change, it was their testimonial plus Everestâs âvery flexible schedule,â that appealed. He said Everest had told him the electrician field was booming with jobs &amp;#8212; âand it is booming if youâre 18 and youâre living at home with mom and dad,â he said. He faults Everest for not specifying that the jobs wouldnât pay him what he needed as a middle-aged guy with a family. Since graduating almost a year ago, heâs had only one job interview, and he found it on his own. He still works in logistics for a stock room company. His electrician program cost more than $19,000. Heâs had to put his loans in deferral as he pays off the Everest loans for the rest of his family.
