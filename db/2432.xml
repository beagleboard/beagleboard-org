Nearly two-thirds of the 238 people killed by lightning in the past seven years were enjoying recreational activities â a number that varied from 26 in 2011 to 48 in 2006, according to a study by lightning safety specialist John Jensenius Jr. The study dispels the myth that golfers are highest on the fatality list.
