Typically, he used the neck as a demarcation line. Quarterbacks needed to be tutored above the neck for the mental part and trained below the neck for the physical aspect of the position. Cutcliffe reviewed tape of Manning throwing early in rehabilitation and recognized Manning dragging his arm. He called Manning to tell him to stop throwing. He was going to hurt himself. The lowest point Cutcliffe witnessed during the process was on the drives from Cutcliffeâs house to Duke. Manning questioned himself, âShould I be doing this?â
