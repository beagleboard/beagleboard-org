The blankness of that blue sea on our maps of the earth applies to the people who work on it too: buy your Fairtrade coffee beans, by all means, but don&amp;rsquo;t assume that Fairtrade governs the conditions of the people who fetch it to you. You would be mistaken. The great Norwegian-American seafarer unionist Andrew Furuseth &amp;ndash; known as Lincoln of the Sea for his cheekbones and achievements &amp;ndash; was once threatened with prison for violating an injunction during a 1904 strike. &apos;You can throw me in jail,&amp;rsquo; he responded. &apos;But you can&amp;rsquo;t give me narrower quarters than, as a seaman, I&amp;rsquo;ve always lived in, or a coarser food than I&amp;rsquo;ve always eaten, or make me lonelier than I&amp;rsquo;ve always been.&amp;rsquo; More than a century on, seafarers still regularly joke that their job is like being in prison with a salary. That is not accurate.

The diet offered by the BBC is definitely preferable, though it is true that it should avoid routinely making the same sort of demotic programmes as its rivals.
