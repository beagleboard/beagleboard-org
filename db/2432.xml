Dr Dangour, who is also a senior research fellow at the Department for International Development (DfID), added: âProviding clean water, sanitation and hygiene is an effective way to reduce the incidence and associated deaths from diseases such as diarrhoea â which remains the third biggest killer of under-fives worldwide. For the first time our analysis suggests that better access to these services may also have a small but important impact on the growth of young children.â
