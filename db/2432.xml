There&amp;#8217;s the disappearance of manufacturing jobs, the classic route into the middle class. Between 1969 and 1999, New York lost four hundred thousand such jobs, and as the jobs vanished so did the workers. (The population decreased by eight hundred thousand during the seventies.) The decline in manufacturing was partly the result of the factors that deindustrialized cities across the Northeast and the Midwest, as new transportation networks and cheaper labor lured industry first to the Sun Belt and then abroad. But it was also driven by city policies that were designed to foster the growth of the financial and real-estate industries, and the effects of those policies are more or less irreversible. The city has tried to regenerate manufacturing in places like the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but deindustrialization continues: between 2001 and 2011, New York lost fifty-one per cent of its remaining manufacturing jobs.
