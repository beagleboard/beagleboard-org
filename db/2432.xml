And despite far superior pitching and a lineup with no soft spots, the $148 million Tigers barely were able to hold off Terry Franconaâs late-charging $81 million Cleveland Indians for the AL Central title.

I wonder if ginger boy would prefer a name that more accurately reflects the current regime in Washington? You know, like the Washington Libtards.
