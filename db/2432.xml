    <body>I&apos;ve been made redundant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/vetmedsdirectcouk-reviews-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;vetmedsdirect.co.uk reviews&lt;/a&gt;  One thing people need to recognize is the difference between real economic growth and the Fed propping up the economy artificially. If them tapering back on the QE causes this much of a reaction it indicates that people don&amp;#8217;t have that much faith. Obviously it was going to happen at some time, we just didn&amp;#8217;t have an exact date. Now the time is here and everyone wants to act like the sky is falling.
