Numerous rumors involve this tech giant for its future plans but Apple declines to comment any of them. Weâve seen reports earlier that Apple wants to distance itself completely from Samsung by ditching it as a supplier for its processor chips. Several big companies have been mentioned that will take Samsungâs place but there wasnât anything official. Now, a new report shows that nothing is changed and Samsung once again will be the number 1 processor chip supplier for Apple.
