    <body>Could you give me some smaller notes? &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/stmap_b1c80.html?viagra.emsam.cabgolin.malegra-dxt&quot;&gt;trandate prijs&lt;/a&gt;  Julie Cook, a public relations professional in Michigan, recently closed on her first home, a three-bedroom ranch outside Detroit. After living in New York City and paying sky-high rent for a few years, the Detroit native recently moved back to the area and decided to take advantage of more affordable home prices. &quot;At this point, it was a better way to spend my money than putting it into rent,&quot; she says. &quot;I might as well get equity.&quot; She lived with her parents for three months while she saved money for a down payment and browsed properties with her real estate agent. She secured an FHA loan earlier this year and moved into her new house last month.
