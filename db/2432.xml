It is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest sports events and we want to be able to showcase not only the tournament course, but also Gleneagles&amp;rsquo; strengths as an international golf resort. Over the last couple of years I have been involved in working with the green staff to help with the set up of the new layout and managing the huge surge in demand we have seen from visitors who want to play the PGA course, especially since that dramatic victory at Medinah. Now my main role is to liaise with Ryder Cup Europe, and both team captains, to make sure all their golfing needs are catered for. I have already had several meetings with Paul McGinley, and we have shown both Tom Watson and Andy North around the course to explain some of the changes since 2011.

He mentioned Bucko Kilroy and Mike Holovak and Gil Brandt and Ron Wolf, but not Young. He mentioned &amp;ldquo;the great Harry Carson,&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t mention Simms, his battlefield commander, either.
