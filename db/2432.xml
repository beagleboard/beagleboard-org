His arrest is extremely upsetting, and this situation is being handled internally as well as in coordination with NFL policies.&quot;

I had a look at this the other month, at the special commercial version with a special rate for Business. (Its the only way I can get one to fit the budget) I have to say the experience was one of the worst I have ever had (Well apart form Audi). Snooty member of staff who kept trying to get me to for a Range Rover. i explained I need a workhorse that can also act as a temporary van but doesn&apos;t look like one. When asking about the base spec, was only barraged with options to take. I also had to track some poor guy in a car park with one in the spec I wanted to see what it was like as the delaer lied that he had one, only high spec versions. 24hr test? Out of the question. i am possibly moving form a 4 door MB saloon and desperately need more carrying ability. I will definitely not be going to the dealer again, I might entertain LR/RR somewhere else, but they need to treat prospective buyers with a brain and courtesy. I like LR and if I needed a full time 4x4, would be my first choice, but this experience really put me off. At the moment looks like it will be an MB estate or 4x4 at this rate. Or a Dacia Duster (It has the capacity I need and the money saved would pay for a good few treats somewhere else for me), which is a left field choice but the dealer was 1000 times more accomodating and more pleasant than the LR one.Â
