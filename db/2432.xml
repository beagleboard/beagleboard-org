The first 1,000-plus crowd was in 1993, and attendance doubled each of the next three years before reaching 23,000 in 1999. The crowd was capped at 50,000 under a five-year permit that expired in 2010. The new multi-year permit allows a maximum crowd of 70,000, but organizers applied for a cap of 68,000 this year.

They live in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, with their two childÂ­ren, Wilfred, who was born in February 2011, and Charlotte, born last October. Spending months away on tour can be tough on family life. &apos;It is awful when you have little kids who don&amp;rsquo;t understand why you are going away, and you see their little faces crumple up when you disappear,&amp;rsquo; he says. &apos;You get back from a tour and everything is great and then you go to the shops to buy something and your kids go into meltdown because they think you&amp;rsquo;ve left them.
