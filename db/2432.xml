A number of surveys uncover disturbing trends in the way we choose to spend lunch time at work &amp;ndash; with hefty workloads and the pressure to do more with less time being the chief reasons. In 2010, the job search website Monster found that more than 20 percent of workers say they always eat lunch at their desks. This year, CareerBuilder found that 8 percent of more than 3,600 full-time employees grab lunch from out of the breakroom vending machine at least once a week.
