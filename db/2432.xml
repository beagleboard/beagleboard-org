The first is to take the process away from the control of the AMA and put it in the hands of a well-resourced group of experts under the auspices of the federal government. This might take the form of a panel of doctors employed by the government, or of an advisory committee of representatives of different medical societies but with greater representation of primary care doctors. While the latter set-up would hardly eliminate all conflicts of interest and political horse trading, such a committee would at least have to meet federal requirements for disclosure of all conflicts of interest. It would also be required to publish minutes from the meetings, data from any surveys used, and so forth. That would be a big improvement over the current, closed-door policy at the RUC, which, because it&amp;#8217;s convened by a private entity, the AMA, enjoys First Amendment freedom from federal disclosure rules.

The company stumbled in recent years trying to catch up with the likes of Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics. Whitman is trying to turn the company around, but she has warned that it will be a long-term endeavor.
