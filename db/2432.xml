At least he offered a slice of real talk when he acknowledged: âFor the last 14 years thereâs always been a mix (of boos and cheers). Do you ever get 100% of anything? Even Chicago was a mix. Bostonâs going to be a mix â well, maybe not Boston.â

However, on seeing that a friend and I had added ice to avoid drinking lukewarm rosé wine, a Twitter acquaintance suggested freezing pink wine too, &amp;ldquo;prettier, and no dilution&amp;rdquo;. I agree with prettier, but if you put enough ice in a glass there isn&amp;rsquo;t too much dilution anyway &amp;ndash; the colder you can get it, the more slowly all the ice melts. And &amp;ndash; depending on what you are drinking &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t think that diluting wine with a bit of water is particularly heinous. If it is a crime at all it is certainly less serious than drinking it steamingly, soupily hot, and it helps with rehydration. Speaking of which &amp;ndash; when was it last so hot as to need jugs of tap water lying around the place (slices of cucumber preferred to slices of lemon) for constant top-ups?

But we tend to encounter difficulty and resistance in turning the mirror on ourselves. The concept of females playing hard to get is as old as time itself, but passing casual social commentary on this behavioural trait &amp;ndash;particularly it seems if you&amp;rsquo;re a man singing about it - lands you very quickly in the &amp;lsquo;misogyny&amp;rsquo; category.
