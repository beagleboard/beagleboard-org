The honor was bestowed on Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins based on their work contributing to the understanding of nucleic acids and not exclusively for their DNA structure discoveries. However, Crick wrote in 1961 that Franklin&apos;s data was &quot;the data we actually used&quot; to formulate their hypothesis on the structure of DNA.
