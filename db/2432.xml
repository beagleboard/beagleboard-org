    <body>Will I have to work shifts? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?cialis.clozaril.tegretol.griseofulvin&quot;&gt;diabetes destroyer book&lt;/a&gt;  âIn response to an interview that ESPN Radio 104.5 FM host Mike Lindsley claims to have done with me on (Monday) afternoon, I would like to set the record straight that I did not participate in any such interview,â said Spencer, who now serves as the hitting coach and third base coach for the Somerset Patriots in the independent Atlantic League. âSomeone called into the station claiming to be me and spoke on my behalf regarding some very sensitive topics surrounding baseball. This caller spoke as me about topics ranging from steroids, to my time with the New York Yankees, Roger Clemens and my feelings about the great Mariano Rivera. I am outraged that someone would do this and at the same time disappointed that the station believed it to be me despite not coming from the contact information they had for me.â
