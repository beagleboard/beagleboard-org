But first the plan would have to overcome questions about its safety and financing.

Among European nations polled, Russia was ranked dead last in tolerance of homosexuality.Â

Ms. Dynan, a co-director of economic studies and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was nominated as assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury, a post vacated when Janice Eberly returned to her teaching position at Northwestern University.

As a 20-year-old on his first England tour of South Africa in 1999-2000 he got drunk on Stroh rum, chatted up flight attendants in clubs, twice missed the team bus, and irritated the coach Duncan Fletcher to such an extent that he was banished from the England set-up and didn&amp;rsquo;t reappear for another seven years, until he was recalled to the one-day international (ODI) team in 2007. When he made his belated Test debut, against India in December 2008, Swann was 29. (His current bowling colleagues Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Steven Finn and Tim Bresnan all made their Test debuts in their early 20s.) Swann has made up for lost time, taking 222 Test and 103 ODI wickets, surpassing Jim Laker as England&amp;rsquo;s most prolific off-spinner of all time and being praised as &apos;the best spin bowler in the world&amp;rsquo; by the great Australian spinner Shane Warne. &apos;Those years out of the England team made me more pragmatic about the decisions you make and how they can influence your career,&amp;rsquo; Swann says. &apos;But it also makes you hungrier when you get back in. Some people are very mature and very sensible from a young age and have wonderful, uninterrupted careers. But for every Alastair Cook there is a Graeme Swann who cocks it up. I feel sorry for the guys who mess up to the extent that they never come back. I was one of the lucky ones.&amp;rsquo;
