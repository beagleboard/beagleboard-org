    <body>Your account&apos;s overdrawn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?levitra.lithium.reglan&quot;&gt;indomethacin drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  On this particular trip I had two nights in LA. On the first I went to Beacher&amp;rsquo;s Madhouse, which I had good memories of. The premise of this place is that it is run by dwarfs and midgets, who perform lip-synch shows and impersonations of music icons, and serve drinks. I gravitated towards it previously because I was in search of old America, of the days of the freak show and the circus, the America depicted by Katherine Dunn in the book Geek Love, or the film Freaks. But this time it was a disappointment. It was Labor Day weekend and the club was overpriced ($200 just to get in and stand) and the show was a load of drunk men who looked like they fell on to the stage from a local bar miming to awful music. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed and won&amp;rsquo;t be going back.
