The fifth graders were volunteering at a Girl Scout Informational night at the school to share their stories about their experiences in the group. Instead of placing ads on TV, in newspapers and on billboards, a decentralized campaign aimed at reversing a long-running decline in participation in the Girl Scouts will unfold in neighborhood initiatives and on social media as local councils directly target elementary school girls - even kindergartners - with promises of adventuresome fun.

And while it is worth debating and litigatingwho is at fault and who should suffer most, some underlyingfacts have to be reckoned with. Detroit&apos;s population and taxbase have shrunk while its obligations to the holders of its $9billion in debts and a (contested) additional $9 billion tomunicipal pensioners have not.
