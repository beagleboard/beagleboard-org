Larryâs fundamental commitment was to optimism, not to free market capitalism, and with the sharp turn to statist solutions at the end of the Bush administration which continued on into Obamaâs presidency I became less and less optimistic about the economy. Larry kept looking for silver linings in economic abominations like Cash for Clunkers. He started to describe Obama as âReaganesque,â nicknaming him âthe Supply-Sider at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,â on the basis of the merest tiny rhetorical hint from the White House. He kept going on about âV-shaped recoveryâ in his segment Kudlow 101, standing in front of a touch screen and using his finger to draw Vs on top of data charts which looked much more like painfully elongated checkmarks. More recently his columns have been praising the zero interest rate and âunlimited easingâ policies of the U.S. and Japanese central banks. This is free market capitalism?
