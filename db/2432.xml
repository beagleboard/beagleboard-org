    <body>I&apos;m sorry, she&apos;s  &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?cialis.topiramate.casodex&quot;&gt;meclizine goodrx&lt;/a&gt;  Avoiding content is an old campaign strategy, but there are other important factors. They are the classics: the really good situation of the economy, which makes it difficult to campaign from the point of view of the opposition. And this was &amp;#8211; according to me &amp;#8211; the overwhelming factor &amp;#8211; especially compared to others in Europe &amp;#8211; the low unemployment rate in Germany etc. The people don&amp;#8217;t feel the crisis, the people are essentially doing well and there is no mood for change. This was the first point. The second point is that the Chancellor as a person is seen &amp;#8211; even by those who do not really like her &amp;#8211; as someone doing well, one can somehow trust her. This feeling that she is creating is that people feel comfortable in general and she personifies that.
