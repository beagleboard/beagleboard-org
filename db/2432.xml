That makes sense; the elder President Bush has been ailing on and off over the last year, and the younger former president recently had a procedure done on his heart. He sent a lovely and gracious statement to mark the day. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush declined to take the place of his family members, and we can&apos;t blame him for that. However sincere and well-intentioned he might be, and however apolitical his remarks might have been, it&apos;s a certainty that many reporters and pundits would interpret his presence as some sort of kick-off for the 2016 campaign. That would not only have been terribly unfair, but it would have detracted from the purpose of the day. Jeb Bush was actually displaying his respect for the memory of Martin Luther King by staying away and keeping 2016 talk out of the story.

You start with the base driver, and then you take out all parts that don&apos;t look like Xbox One and you add in everything that really optimises that experience.â
