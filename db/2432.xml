In 2000, James wrote and starred in Storm Damage, a BBC film based on his own experience of growing up in foster care. It follows a teacher who&amp;rsquo;s shocked by the violence of the teens in his class and returns to work in the care home he grew up in. When Storm Damage aired, Pearson and Run&amp;rsquo;s writers Marlon Smith and Daniel Fajemisin-Duncan were schoolboys in south London. &amp;ldquo;They were part of the generation that Storm Damage was about and they saw it and they were like, &amp;lsquo;we want to tell our version of south London like that one day&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; However, their version had a long gestation process with plans for an online series of shorts in 2007 eventually leading to a pilot and then a full-length script which they sent to James directly. In a letter they explained the impact that Storm Damage had had on them. &amp;ldquo;Before I&amp;rsquo;d even read the script I&amp;rsquo;d said yes. It was set in the neighbourhood that I grew up in and it was an opportunity to come home and work with guys who were from my neck of the woods.&amp;rdquo;
