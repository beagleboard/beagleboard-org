In 2011, Barack Obama said he would like the US to have a million plug-in electric vehicles by 2015. Last year just over 50,000 were sold. The number is predicted to double in 2013 but it is still some way off seven figures.

Losing three straight NFC Championship games from 1980-82 was treated like a 6-10 season. The Cowboys lost the heartbreaking 1981 title game to the 49ers on Dwight Clarkâs catch, and Schramm, the Cowboys president, never held court and proclaimed coming so close to the Super Bowl a moral victory.
