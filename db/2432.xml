Looks like you have a mental problem with your ego and schizophrenia. Oh well, here&apos;s the link to the brokers comment. I was in the union for thirty years and yes our union is concerned about the same thing. You must be one of the millions without a job, leaching of the government , collecting your unemployment and voting the &quot;man&quot; in office again so you can maintain your Piece of $hi  lazy lifestyle of living off of others hard work.
