Two Ohio consumers reported losing about $800 each after receiving a call from someone claiming to represent a utility company and demanding payment.

This was previously done on price, so an expensive bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape would be charged more than a mid-priced bottle of Ontario Cabernet. Under the new deal, the charge will be on volume, theoretically making the European wine cheaper, if savings are passed on, with the prospect they could eat into the Ontario wine market. The provincial government is looking for compensation for producers who are adversely affected but the federal officials say none is being considered.

Only, without a more complete understanding of economics, he couldn&amp;#8217;t make his vision work. The result was, his big spending programs only created an even bigger fiscal hole! Obama&amp;#8217;s agenda was designed for better times.
