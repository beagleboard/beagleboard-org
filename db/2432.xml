    <body>I&apos;ve got a part-time job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdesighn.com/consumerhealthchoicesorg-b26f.pdf&quot;&gt;consumerhealthchoices.org/about-us/&lt;/a&gt;  The main reason, he said, is that the money flowing to the 16 states and the nation&apos;s capital that are running their own ACA exchange is what&apos;s called a &quot;permanent appropriation,&quot; enshrined in the 2010 healthcare reform law.
