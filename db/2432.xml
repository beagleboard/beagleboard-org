    <body>Very Good Site &lt;a href=&quot;https://newscvm.com/scimedpharmacynarkivecom-e9bb.pdf&quot;&gt;naturalimedicina.lt&lt;/a&gt;  Manning Bowl I at Giants Stadium was a tightly contested affair that ended in a 26-21 Colts victory. The rematch at Lucas Oil Stadium, however, was a 38-14 drubbing as Peyton completed 20 of 26 passes for 255 yards and three touchdowns. Eli threw two TD passes himself, but had only 161 yards, an interception and two fumbles, one of which was returned for a touchdown.
