The Bundesbank is actually still &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; more than 30 billion D-Mark. As the Bundesbank still converts the old currency into euros the experts are quite often needed to proof the genuineness of the money &amp;#8211; making some people, without them even playing the lottery, unexpectedly rich!
