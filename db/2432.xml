    <body>I live in London &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/stmap_9e880.html?acular.levitra.sustinex&quot;&gt;bellegrove medical redmond wa&lt;/a&gt;  Asked if he thought he had wasted his time, he said: &quot;No. I did a professional job, I published the report, it was on the web, everyone could read it. I don&apos;t feel I wasted my time, totally the contrary, you think if it was a waste of time, you&apos;d all be interviewing me today?

What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise is that Vikram, with his charisma and charm, did get to those people who absolutely shocked and surprised me that they talked.&amp;rdquo;

Your PC has a number of built-in features that can help to make it easier to use. But first, here is a quick tip for web surfing. Most browsers have a simple zoom facility; just hold down the Ctrl key and press &amp;lsquo; &amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;-&amp;lsquo; to increase or decrease the size of the display. The rest of the visibility improving options in Windows 7 and 8 are grouped together in the Ease of Access Centre, in Control Panel. These include an on-screen magnifier, high-contrast colour schemes and options to increase the size of text on menus and icons. I suggest that experiment with them all to see which ones best suit your needs. However, the root of your problem is the small screen. If the purchase was recent one it may be worth talking to the retailer who sold the laptop. Ask them nicely if they would consider taking it back as you would like to upgrade to a model with a larger screen. This probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to you by now but for future reference you are entitled to a full refund, no questions asked, if you change your mind and return the laptop &amp;ndash; in good condition along with all of the accessories and packing, of course -- within 28 days of purchase.
