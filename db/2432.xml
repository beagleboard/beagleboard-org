Time to seriously reform Military Training to remove the dehumanization of the &amp;#8220;enemy&amp;#8221; from the indoctrination. &amp;#8220;The enemy&amp;#8221; are just soldiers, just like them, and when they kill one, it&amp;#8217;s like killing one of their own.

Relatively cheap chips, cookies and sugary soft drinks pack the shelves of the convenience stores and mom-and-pop groceries that are as common here as cacti, even in poor rural towns and villages.
