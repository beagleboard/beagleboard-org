    <body>How do you know each other? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/iom-viagrande-telefono-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;bay viagra uk&lt;/a&gt;  The whole piece is worth a read just for the quotes from the moneyed conservative interests who have happily made common cause with the tea party&apos;s semi-libertarian, quasi-populist Jacobins but seem to have suddenly realized that the fringe really is (a) loopy, (b) more in charge of day-to-day GOP strategy than the business community and (c) actively hostile to the traditional big business-GOP alliance. &quot;There clearly are people in the Republican Party at the moment for whom the business community and the interests of the business community &amp;ndash; the jobs and members they represent &amp;ndash; don&apos;t seem to be their top priority,&quot; the National Federation of Independent Business&apos; Dan Danner tells the Times, apparently surprised that the grassroots foot soldiers have turned on them.
