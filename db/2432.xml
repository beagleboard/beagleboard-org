Rodney gave up a walk and a hit to start the inning. A bunt put runners on second and third and the Rays elected to play their infield back and Boston tied the game up on Pedroiaâs ground ball to shortstop. âThat was a difficult choice right there,â Maddon said, âbut ... I thought it best to concede one run and live for the bottom of the ninth.â
