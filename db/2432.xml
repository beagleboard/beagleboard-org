    <body>I&apos;ve got a part-time job &lt;a href=&quot;https://newscvm.com/steroneis-e9bb.pdf#fell&quot;&gt;alapharma.com&lt;/a&gt;  Lorcan spoke &amp;ldquo;very well, very early&amp;rdquo; but clammed up in front of strangers as a toddler. He was also a bad sleeper. But it was only when he started nursery that the Dillons realised there was a problem. On his first day, he refused to take his hat and coat off and didn&amp;rsquo;t say a word. &amp;ldquo;At first, we thought he was just taking longer to settle than other children. But it went on. And on,&amp;rdquo; says Jayne.
