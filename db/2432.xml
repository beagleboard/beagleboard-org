Maybe 200 years ago politicians sought office because they actually wanted to help the masses, but not now. They are in it for power - pure and simple. If she or any other pol wanted to serve because they thought they could actually do some good, they&apos;d serve their term, leave and go back to the private sector. These people never leave office. They love sucking off the taxpayer tit and it&apos;s people like you who keep voting these dirtbags into office. Don&apos;t confuse her with someone in the armed forces either, you dope...
