Over the next three days, I meet people who have been looking forward to the event like excited schoolchildren, planning their whole year around it. British expats John and Emma have flown in from Vancouver for the weekend. Bev and Tony from Telford have made the Ryder Cup the centrepiece of a fly-drive holiday around the Great Lakes. &amp;ldquo;We have been to Formula One events in Europe, but this is a first,&amp;rdquo; says Tony. &amp;ldquo;Some show, eh? Beats 20/20 cricket.&amp;rdquo; Then there is the elderly Austrian couple sitting in fold-up chairs beside the fourth green, proudly waving their European flags. They now live in Nashville, Tennessee, where they own a cigar shop.
