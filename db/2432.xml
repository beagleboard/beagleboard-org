    <body>Will I have to work shifts? &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoeydeutch.net/beast-protein-8f08.pdf&quot;&gt;beast protein shake&lt;/a&gt;  Had this occurred in the private sector, politicians would be calling for action and the guilty would be facing serious consequences. Not so in the NHS. On Monday, the General Medical Council (GMC) announced that it was closing its cases against four doctors who worked as managers at Mid-Staffs during its period of decline. The GMC concluded that it could not link the actions of these individuals to the terrible events, a finding that probably means the grounds for criminal prosecution are limited. Victims have said they are &amp;ldquo;bitterly disappointed&amp;rdquo;, and rightly so. Out of 44 cases taken to the GMC related to Mid-Staffs, all but one was either dropped or saw the doctor merely advised to improve their performance. A single doctor, Dr Adil Farouk Elamin, was struck off the register for over-claiming expenses.
