    <body>Punk not dead  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/epicatechin-gallate-sigma-75b3.pdf#dairy&quot;&gt;epicatechin myostatin&lt;/a&gt;  With a 104.3â³ wheelbase, 173.6â³ length, 63.9â³ height and 72â³ width, the C-MAX is compact but not tiny. Just 5.5â³ of ground clearance encourages you to stay on the pavement. Exterior design is not a great strongpoint of the C-MAX. Itâs a very conservative, two-box setup, with a steeply raked windshield and contours that look like they were designed to cheat the wind. A little taller than the prototypical hatchback design, but still sleek and smooth. A gently-rising shoulder line connects the front and rear lamps, tying both ends of the vehicle together nicely. A liftgate provides access to the cargo area â 19.2 cubic feet behind the second row, 42.8 cubic feet with the second row folded. The Lithium Ion battery pack takes up a good amount of space here, mounted beneath the load floor, but the remaining space is still quite useable.
