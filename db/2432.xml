While there has been an undoubted increase in &amp;#8220;hard work&amp;#8221; especially at the lower, independent business level, there has also been a gigantic increase in legal discrimination originally intended to deal with the problems of an America over half a century gone. The Federal Government has built, for most Americans, a new Ottoman Empire. Rulers are dynastic and arrogant and isolated from the ruled. Political procedures are more like unvarying religious rituals. Ethnic sub-groups are left alone unless disobedient, with the exception of lower class whites. Emphasis is on accreting ever more wealth and power to the Oligarchs.

Faldo won the first of his major titles at Muirfield in 1987. Five years later, he added his name to the claret jug again at the very same place.

From my 25 year-experience, mainly in the US but latterly Britain, I would say that the pool of talent in this country would always be too small for such a lofty ambition.

And on the ensuing handoff Wilson rushed for what would have been a possible game-tying TD â except the play was negated by a holding call on left tackle Will Beatty. Three plays later, Josh Brownâs 38-yard field-goal attempt went wide left, and that, said Manning, âkind of killed all the momentum that we had going for us.â
