It helps that ValueAct is a long-only fund at a time when the market has been generally headed up. But ValueAct is also a concentrated portfolio. The fund owns just 12 stocks, which increases the risk the fund will falter. But Ubben and his partners have clearly been choosing their investments wisely.
