    <body>Where do you study? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/myminthealthcom-0bae.pdf#producer&quot;&gt;medrockgroup.com&lt;/a&gt;  With free trade favouring the evening out of world wages, it looks like more of the same in the future with the West getting poorer and the East getting richer. So who in the West is benefitting from having pushed all this free trade? Clearly industrialists who enhance profits by making stuff in China; the managerial and executive classes who are monetarily incentivised to export jobs to low cost economies; and consumers (temporarily) who can buy cheaper products imported from the cheaper producers &amp;#8211; until they have no jobs or insufficient income to pay for all the high-living and debt they take on, mortgaging their children&amp;#8217;s futures for a newer, bigger, brighter TVs or cars before they have saved up for them.
