    <body>Is it convenient to talk at the moment? &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoeydeutch.net/gleaming-teeth-8f08.pdf&quot;&gt;gleaming teeth&lt;/a&gt;  In his five decades as a whaler, Kristiansen has weathered many a storm, both at sea and on land. He lived through the dangerous years of the eco-wars, when activists sabotaged and sank a number of Lofoten whaling boats. And he survived a horrific shipboard accident a few years ago when his harpoon cannon backfired, nearly killing him and leaving him with a mangled left hand. He was back hunting whales the following season.
