    <body>We work together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/stmap_76840.html?levitra.cystone.furosemide&quot;&gt;steroidal.com&lt;/a&gt;  Whatever angst anyone felt over the last eight months or so as the Giants and Cruzâs various people haggled over what turned into a six-year, $45.879 million deal, thatâs nothing compared to what lies ahead as Nicks moves to the head of the line. He, not Cruz, is the Giantsâ No. 1 receiver, but he has a long history of injuries that complicates his value. Heâs going to want an enormous deal â think Mike Wallace and the five-year, $60 million deal he got from Miami â that could be too big of a risk for the salary cap-strapped Giants to take.
