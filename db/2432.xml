 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/pharmztua-bd82.pdf#changing&quot;&gt;www.kosmed.fi&lt;/a&gt;  Federal prosecutors called a total of 63 witnesses over 6 Â½ weeks before resting their case Friday. The final day of government witness testimony featured an FBI agent&apos;s account of Bulger&apos;s arrest more than two years ago. The agent described luring Bulger from his apartment with a ruse about his storage locker being broken into, then told the court how the longtime fugitive led agents to 30 guns and more than $800,000 he&apos;d hidden away. Earlier, Bulger&apos;s former partner and friend, Stephen &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Flemmi, described Bulger&apos;s role in a string of killings during the 1970s and 80s &amp;#x2014; either as their planner, authorizer or executor. Flemmi told the court Bulger strangled two young women and was a pedophile who had taken a 16-year-old on a vacation to Mexico. Flemmi and Bulger exchanged obscenities as court adjourned following one of Flemmi&apos;s days on the stand.

This has caused a minor shock to income-oriented investors.
