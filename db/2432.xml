And if there should be a U.S.-led strike against Syria, Iran could be drawn into the fray, according to Rowhani, who said he would work with Russia in âextensive cooperationâ to retaliate against any military action by the U.S. in Syria.

I hope it&apos;s well-founded, but I remain skeptical that this is &amp;ndash; or should be &amp;ndash; the last we&apos;ll hear about filibuster abuse and reform.

Kohl rabi likes a moist, fertile soil which is slightly alkaline. Add some balanced fertiliser a couple of days before sowing if it&apos;s dry in late spring and early summer. Sow little and often through the summer in seed drills 1.5cm deep by 15cm apart, covering with a little compost then thin the seedlings to around 10 apart. Plants should grow rapidly and, if you sow in late March, the first roots should be ready in early May and can be pulled when they reach the size of a golf ball. Trim off the long root and outer leaves, leaving the stem with a small tuft of leaves. Kohl rabi has a mild, sweet flavour, somewhere between a turnip and a waterchestnut, with a crisp, crunchy texture. It can be found in two colours, pale green and the less common purple and can be eaten raw, or roasted, steamed or stir-fried. Good varieties include the purple-skinned, quick maturing &apos;Azur Star&apos;, which has a good resistance to bolting, and &apos;White Vienna&apos;, a green-skinned fast-maturing type.
