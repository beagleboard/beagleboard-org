    <body>How many days will it take for the cheque to clear? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/volt-athletics-sign-in-bac9.pdf#snorted&quot;&gt;volt athletics linkedin&lt;/a&gt;  The Ashbourne Portfolio Priority A loan is the senior-most tranche of a complex package of debt amounting to GBP328m and secured by a portfolio of nursing homes. Following Southern Cross&apos;s bankruptcy in 2011, two new operators have been installed to run the portfolio under a management agreement. After a period in which liquidity had to be drawn to service note interest, at the most recent (April) interest payment date, EBTIDA was sufficient to pay interest on the securitised portion of the debt facility. While this is a positive development, Fitch is concerned about the level of recoveries. The (yet-to-be-distributed) proceeds from two recently sold homes are well below the latest valuation (in 2011). Fitch notes that swap breakage costs will likely act as a drag until 2015.
