For Mulligan, this renewed ownership of local decision-making has led to a variety of &quot;pilots&quot; &amp;ndash; experiments if you will &amp;ndash; to tackle some fundamental issues in policing in her area that have previously been ignored due to a lack of time, or money, or both. Issues on Mulligan&apos;s priority list, she tells me, include the lack of access to support for sexual assault victims and the problem of under age drinking.
