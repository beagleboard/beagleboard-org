He became the fifth quarterback in SEC history to throw for more than 10,000 career yards. Still, Cutcliffeâs security grew tenuous once Eli left. The Rebels went 4-7 the next year â Cutcliffeâs first losing season â and he was fired. He led Ole Miss to a 44-29 record and four bowl wins in just over six years as head coach at the school.

So in this paper, the astronomers did their best to estimate the âhabitable zone lifetimeâ of a planet. Since life took hundreds of millions of years to evolve on Earth, the researchers reason that the best candidates for observation are those with the longest habitable zone lifetimes.
