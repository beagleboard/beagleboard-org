The Chief Constable arranged an escort to drive her to Manchester. When she went on holiday two Daily Mirror reporters were on the plane. She didn&amp;rsquo;t talk to them or anyone in the cars that chased her round Vancouver. Back home she didn&amp;rsquo;t sign up with the agent who said he&amp;rsquo;d make her a lot of money.

The bouncing camera feels a bit too jarring during the opening land-based scenes, but proves to be a great asset in conveying the tension and disorientation during the hijacking, And the danger. Like the captured crew, we never know when a gun barrel will appear as we sneak along the deck. And there&amp;#8217;s the mood of impending danger. GreengrassÂ even does a bit of a Hitchcock homage&amp;#8217; as Hanks peers through his binoculars and sees AbdiÂ staring right back at him (ala&amp;#8217; REAR WINDOW). For the third act GreengrassÂ cuts expertly between the miliary precision of the US naval forces and the increasing desperation on the lifeboat. But this is no open-air canoe (like another Hitchcock classic LIFEBOAT). This vessel is almost an above-the-water submarine with very small windows. In the interior scenes we can almost smell the sweat and breathe the stale air in this big fiberglass coffin. Although this story dominated headlines for many days, the film still has a sense of urgency and discovery. The news reports just hinted at the drama. GreengrassÂ along with his extraordinary cast and crew have truly made history come alive. The riveting CAPTAIN PHILLIPS will have you on the edge of your seatÂ as you experience one of the finest films of the year.

The attack ended on Tuesday when Kenyan troops detonated explosives to get through locked doors inside the mall as they searched for militants or booby traps.
