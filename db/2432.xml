JWoww) has never been shy about showing off her assets, but this time the MTV celebrity is baring it all for a good reason! Donning a duct tape bra (and later going topless), JWoww joined the ranks of sexy celebrities posing for the NOH8 campaign in support of marriage equality. &quot;It was a great experience,&quot; she said told MTV about the shoot.
