What Henry Konietzky believed to be a bug bite on his ankle turned out to be a bacterial infection. His wife, Patty Konietzky, took him to the hospital. But he soon died from the spreading infection, anyway. According to health officials, people with compromised immune systems are at the highest risk of being affected by Vibrio vulnificus.

Following the success of &quot;Jerry Maguire,&quot; Lipnicki went on to star in two &quot;Stuart Little&quot; films and &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; before deciding to step away from the lime light and lead a normal teenage life. But now he&apos;s back ... and he looks totally different. The former child star has transformed himself into a super buff man and is showing off his super-toned physique in a series of new shirtless photos. With his glasses now gone, the 21-year-old is seen flexing his bulging biceps and six-pack abs while lifting weights and doing pull-ups. Lipnicki also competes in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, according to his website.
