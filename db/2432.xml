She added: &quot;There has never been a more level playing field, with all advice providers giving information about services and costs in a more easily comparable format. I expect advisers to continue to refine costs and services in the next 12 months and we may see a decrease in charges for specific services.&quot;

To hit the ball out like that, it was amazing,â Rivera said of Cabrera. âI didnât ex ecute what I needed to do, bottom line. You canât make excuses for that.â

In 2007, both types of loans had an equal interest rate of 6.8 percent, but a bill in Congress gradually reduced the subsidized rate, reaching 3.4 percent in 2011. Its aim was to make college more affordable and was to last until 2013, but the reduced rates were ended for budgetary reasons and the law&apos;s expiration was moved to 2012. Last June, it was extended one year in a compromise after President Barack Obama encouraged Congress to keep the lower rates.

When President Clinton left office in 2001, we were paying down the national debt at the rate of several hundred billions of dollars a year with budget surpluses. Since that time the Bush administration moved the United States substantially into budget deficits with large tax cuts, major military commitments to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a new prescription drug entitlement â all undertaken without offsetting expenditure reduction or increasing revenue. Beyond these decisions, the largest factor in the current level of deficits is the worst economic downturn since the Depression â a downturn that began under President Bush. People will debate the merits of President Obama&amp;#8217;s stimulus measures â though I think their positive effect on growth and employment is quite clear â but this debate matters little. Government employment has been contracting, and the debate over stimulus has largely faded.
