    <body>It&apos;s OK &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/stmap_a6a40.html?colchicine.cialis.mastigra.prometrium&quot;&gt;clarityrx restore it reviews&lt;/a&gt;  Regarding the debt, do people understand that first you must bring down the deficit? Obama&amp;#8217;s doing that. What more do you want? It&amp;#8217;s coming down faster than any time since WWII. Isn&amp;#8217;t it a little unreasonable to shut down the government and threaten default because the deficit isn&amp;#8217;t dropping fast enough to suit you when it&amp;#8217;s dropping at a near historic rate? Would you agree that it&amp;#8217;s possible to cut too much spending too soon, putting a lot of people out of work and risking another recession? Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you have to agree that the sweet spot is to lower the deficit at a fast rate without threatening to harm the economy? That&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re now doing. Why would you want to mess with that? Remember, we had that sweet spot with Clinton and we let the Republicans mess with it then. The results were catastrophic.
