Idiots like you rely on spell check so much so that they can&apos;t correct their own spelling. I am a teacher, I know stupidity when I see it in writing. Your writing is weaker than an average 2nd grader&apos;s. Much weaker. Let me prove this: your point 1 is based on the assumption that I have superior morality. I never said that. I only applauded Tess42 for having humility (rare among commenters, including myself at times because I know I am not a perfect person nor superior person). Your point 2 is making the assumption on yourself that you are okay with living in a country that does not respect diversity and humanity. Well you already do with you in it because honestly you do not seem to value what different people bring as different strengths and skills to America. Well done (read this with sarcasm if it helps you get my point straight).

He has frequently spoken out in recent weeks about the need for comprehensive immigration reform, urging his GOP colleagues in the House to act on a bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate.
