He was never GM Walt Jockettyâs guy and they clashed openly on a number of occasions this year, beginning in the spring when Jocketty wanted Aroldis Chapman in the starting rotation and Baker fought to keep him as closer. Baker won that one, and itâs a good thing he did, as Chapman had another lights-out year as one of the elite closers in baseball (a perfect 38-for-38 in saves, 112 strikeouts, 29 walks in 63 2 â 3 innings) and Baker lost three of his primary set-up men, Jonathan Broxton, Sean Marshall and Nick Masset, to injuries for considerable periods of time. Baker and Jockettyâs final disagreement came late in the season when Baker pushed for speed merchant Billy Hamilton to be brought up. Jocketty wanted to keep him in the minors but finally relented and Hamilton played a major role in the Reds winning four games down the stretch with his baserunning.

Itâs nothing new. We try to look at both the long-term and short-term, but the short-term is always the goal here. Itâs always about now.â
