Chances are they do not, but you are more than capable of this bad behavior.  Something went wrong in your day so everyone you come in contact with has to pay for whatever injustice the universe has supplied you with. If we take a page out of our petâs book though, we will see sweating the small things is totally unnecessary.  In the grand scheme of things your pet may not face the pressure you do on a daily basis, but have they developed more effective coping skills with the problems they do face? Itâs worth looking in to.
