Back to the BBC, where Charles Anson, the Queen&amp;rsquo;s former press secretary, was calling this &amp;ldquo;the people&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy&amp;rdquo;, and Simon McCoy, presumably in the interests of balance, was reading out complaints from republicans. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;What a lot of sycophantic rubbish,&amp;rsquo; says one&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
