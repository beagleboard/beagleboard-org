    <body>What&apos;s the last date I can post this to  to arrive in time for Christmas? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/vnhealthclinicorg-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmaonline.shopea.cz&lt;/a&gt;  Detroit became the biggest American city to file for bankruptcy after its emergency manager filed for Chapter 9 protection on July 18 with more than $18 billion in accrued obligations. In the filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr indicated that the city&apos;s estimated number of creditors was &quot;over 100,000.&quot; Orr, who was hired in March to assist with the city&apos;s budget, had tried to convince creditors to accept pennies on the dollar to deal with its financial problems.
