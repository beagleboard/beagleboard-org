The sentencing date will be set by the court at a later date. Mazyck assigned the tickets to retailers no longer selling tickets, according to the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office in the Eastern District of Arkansas, then log into the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery&apos;s software program to change the tickets from &quot;Available-Virgin&quot; to &quot;Promotional.&quot; That activated the tickets and allowed Mazyck to cash any winning tickets.

The ride will tower over 400 feet in the air and circle at speeds of up to 40 mph. Once the twenty-four thrill seekers board the ride, it quickly rises, taking guests 40 stories into the air and while spinning round and round, riders will experience breathtaking views of the Connecticut River and New England skyline. At night, the New England SkyScreamer&apos;s bright lights will beckon guests from near and far.

That includes the stones themselves, which will be accessed either by foot or by transit vehicles from the visitor centre. It is clear that the experience of visiting and understanding Stonehenge will be completely transformed.
