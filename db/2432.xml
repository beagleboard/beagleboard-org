    <body>I quite like cooking &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/stmap_3c560.html?loperamide.sporanox.cyclogyl.viagra&quot;&gt;ibuprofen dosage chart infant&lt;/a&gt;  This is my take. Knowing Blackberry announced a fire sale a while back, that enormously bad news was coming out and having Pem Watsa on the inside of Blackberry while being the majority shareholder for the past 1.5 years, it was important to lock in a price. Basically, it was Fairfax declaring they&amp;#8217;d make it work somehow for them at $9 and wouldn&amp;#8217;t accept losing any more. If the price slipped more ano others came in before they did that, there could be a risk of Fairfax losing more. Fairfax is not doing this for the good of the other shareholders, the employees or Canada, they are doing it for them.
