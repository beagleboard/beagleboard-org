    <body>Not in at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?levitra.zebeta.beconase&quot;&gt;neuroactives brainsustain&lt;/a&gt;  That&apos;s a great question, John, and thanks for it. Just to kind of recap the numbers, we are blessed with the fact that in 2012, we overachieved and generated about $75 million of political and Olympic revenues. Then obviously, the next year, you have to compare against that. But you know what, I&apos;ll take that overachievement every time. But if you set aside that high margin -- those dollars and exclude it, we&apos;re actually looking at -- I think in our guidance we said television, total television revenues, up in the mid-teens. Now what we are seeing is continued strength in auto, and you&apos;ve actually hit on something very interesting on the Obamacare side because we actually, led by Dave Lougee, who&apos;s also here with me, and I&apos;ll ask him to pipe in here a moment, we actually are very focused on that, and we see that as potentially a big opportunity for us in the coming quarters as more spending has to take place around the various exchanges and other issues surrounding health care. But Dave, do you want to jump in on that?
