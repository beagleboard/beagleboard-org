I was afraid that I would be judged based on what I looked like. And I learned that I was judging myself when I would look in the mirror, and I would create this idea around: No one will love me this way. I always had this idea that, &quot;Oh my gosh, everyone should look more inside because that&apos;s what it&apos;s all about.&quot; But I discovered that I was just as guilty as the next person of being obsessed with my external appearance.
