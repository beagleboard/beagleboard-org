Listen, a guy like that will take the loss and bounce back from it. Iâve been doing this for 17 years and just because I beat him doesnât mean he wonât still have a good career. Iâm still going strong. I took my time and I think if I had pressed the attack I could have gotten the stoppage. But there were a couple of rounds where we kept bumping arms and my arms hurt so I had to pull back and take my time.â
