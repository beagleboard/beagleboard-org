Though very much not a &amp;ldquo;Jewish comedian&amp;rdquo;, I am Jewish and a comedian and in recent years, perhaps through getting older, it has dawned on me that I am pretty ignorant of many aspects of Jewish history, particularly the folk humour of Jews, the writing of European Jews in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, and how it was that Jews came to dominate stand-up comedy in the United States.

I began many years ago, and I&apos;ve always enjoyed it. I like feeling strong. I can literally feel the improvement after each workout, and I know that at a minimum I&apos;m increasing my strength and my bone mass, and maintaining my weight.
