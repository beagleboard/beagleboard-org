    <body>I have my own business &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssvoverath.de/stmap_c3db0.html?levitra.endep.sustiva&quot;&gt;super hd g4&lt;/a&gt;  In a press release published Monday, BlackBerry said it had formed a committee to explore a number of \&quot;strategic alternatives,\&quot; including, \&quot;among others, possible joint ventures, strategic partnerships or alliances, a sale of the Company or other possible transactions.\&quot; This leaves BlackBerry&apos;s future open to much speculation. Perhaps Apple, Google, or Samsung could be interested in BlackBerry&apos;s patent portfolio, as some have surmised. Or maybe its competitors are interested in acquiring the company for its talent, its enterprise market share, or for products like BBM. Or perhaps a surprise player, like Lenovo, might snatch up the company or partner with it to make a larger play for the mobile market in the U.S.
