    <body>We were at school together &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/best-overall-drugstore-concealer-6a83.pdf#conjecture&quot;&gt;best pharmacy prescription prices&lt;/a&gt;  If you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. If we donât make this investment, weâll put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we must begin in the earliest years. Thatâs why Iâll keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available to every four year-old in America â not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents. Iâll also take action to spur innovation in our schools that donât require Congress. Today, for example, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99% of Americaâs students to high-speed internet over the next five years. And weâve begun meeting with business leaders, tech entrepreneurs, and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.
