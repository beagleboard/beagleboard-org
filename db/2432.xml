The advantage of working with T cells is that T cells don&apos;t just recognize the surface of an organism like an antibody does. They recognize any protein within the parasite â even inside the parasite. Those proteins inside the parasite don&apos;t change, or change very little from one organism to another, whereas the proteins on the surface â the ones that are recognized by the antibodies â they do change from one parasite to another. We worked out a way to induce that population of T cells in a vaccine strategy. Those T cells, at least in our mouse model, have proven to be very effective in killing multiple strains of the parasite.

The subsequent offspring were then bred to produce a second and third generation of rats. None of the follow-up generations of rats were exposed to DDT.
