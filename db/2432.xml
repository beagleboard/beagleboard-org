I will do whatever I can to regain your faith in me and make sure that I represent the school and the Tar Heels with respect in the future. I appreciate Coach Williams giving me another chance to show that I can and will make better choices and decisions. I owe it to my mom, my dad, my coaches and teammates and every Tar Heel out there to make you proud to have me play basketball for Carolina. It was my dream as a kid and I would love more than anything to have that chance once again.&quot;

We have a lot of confidence in the quality and quantity of our starting pitching. Hopefully Matt is part of that rotation next year. If he is not, I donât foresee us working hard to fill this spot from outside the organization.â
