    <body>What do you like doing in your spare time? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlam.com/index.php/stmap_77410.html?viagra.manforce.avodart&quot;&gt;zyvoxid 600 mg infusion preis&lt;/a&gt;  What would a win by Caner mean? According to Kel McClanahan, who is the executive director of National Security Counselors and a transparency activist who&apos;s taken Smathers&apos;s case, &quot;It would mean that requesters can no longer trust the federal government to tell them that something is publicly available. One of the oldest axioms of FOIA law, with very few exceptions, is &apos;a release to one is a release to all.&apos; It is an underpinning of FOIA. And in order for that to work, requesters should not have to do their own independent research to see if it might be copyrighted. The agency has already done that.&quot;
