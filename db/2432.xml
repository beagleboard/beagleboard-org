She veils her head and body but not her face, and covers the heads of her daughters, two and four years old, with hijab scarves that drape over the shoulders. People tell Lukau, who is of Algerian origin, &quot;If you&apos;re not happy, leave, go home,&quot; she said. But, she pointed out, she was born in France.
