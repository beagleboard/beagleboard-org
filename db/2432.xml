    <body>Sorry, I ran out of credit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?cetirizine.entocort.viagra&quot;&gt;amoxicillin vs cephalexin for strep throat&lt;/a&gt;  While Papa John&apos;s is the most egregious example of this marketing mendacity, they&apos;re hardly alone. Olive Garden wants you to believe that eating at one of their restaurants means you&apos;re getting authentic Italian cuisine. Many of its &quot;chefs&quot; have been trained at the company&apos;s Culinary Institute of Tuscany, located, we are told, in a &quot;quaint 11th century Tuscan village.&quot; But Italian cuisine is notoriously fresh, individually prepared and lacking in shortcuts. Are Olive Garden&apos;s offerings anything close to this? They, too, won&apos;t tell you. The allergen chart on the website, though, reveals that there&apos;s soy in the meat sauce and chicken parm, suggesting that Olive Garden&apos;s specialties are closer to Chef Boyardee than something Benedetta Vitali came up with. Applebee&apos;s, Cheesecake Factory, Chili&apos;s and TGIF&apos;s are some of the other sit-down chains that also won&apos;t tell you what&apos;s in their food.
