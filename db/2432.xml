    <body>I need to charge up my phone &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/culinaryhealthfundorg-2206.pdf#sleigh&quot;&gt;gout-treatment-help.com&lt;/a&gt;  This much is certain, though: Because Russia has a general flat income tax rate of 13%, it won&apos;t take much for Kovalchuk to take home more in net pay with the KHL than he would have with the Devils. Over his next four years in New Jersey, Kovalchuk stood to earn $46 million in real gross dollars. But he would have ended up paying $23.45 millionâmore than half of that sumâin federal and state taxes, based on analysis by Robert Raiola, the sports and entertainment group manager at Fazio, Mannuzza, Roche, Tankel and LaPilusa, a New Jersey-based tax, accounting and advisory firm. So to match his after-tax earnings here, Kovalchuk would have had to sign a four-year deal with SKA St. Petersburg worth $6.6 million annually (in American dollars). No matter what Kovalchuk ended up signing forâsome reports have said he&apos;s getting $15-20 million a yearâit&apos;s clear the move will be a financial windfall for him.

Williams, who was voted by NBA GMs as the leagueâs best point guard in 2010 (ahead of Chris Paul in a landslide), didnât garner a single vote in last yearâs poll.
