However, these jobs are not &quot;traditional&quot; retail jobs in the Walmart sense of the word, and many of Amazon&apos;s fulfillment jobs can be low-paying. According to Amazon&apos;s fulfillment jobs website, many &quot;fulfillment associate&quot; positions currently on offer around the country pay around $11 to $12 per hour. That comes out to around $23,000 to $25,000 per year, and is right around the poverty line for a family with two parents and two children, at $23,283, according to the Census Bureau.
