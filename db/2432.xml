From 1990 to 2010, among the OCED countries, the U.S. ranks changed from 18th to 27th for the age-standardized death rate, from 20th to 27th for life expectancy at birth, and from 14th to 26th for HALE.

With runners on first and second, Rodriguez was struck in the side by a 1-1 pitch and winced in pain for a moment before jogging to first base.
