In and around Bardia National Park, where Bhadai Tharu lives, the number of Bengal tigers is estimated to have doubled in four years (from 18 to 37) thanks to a nexus of environmental, community and security initiatives. With things looking pretty bleak for tigers elsewhere in Asia, what&amp;rsquo;s being done in this corner of Nepal could serve as both inspiration and model for the fight to save them, Chapagain believes. I joined him and other WWF officials &amp;ndash; as well as a representative of Whiskas cat food (more of cat food later) &amp;ndash; on a field trip to south-west Nepal to see just how this turnaround has been achieved.
