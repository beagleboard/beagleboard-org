    <body>I was born in Australia but grew up in England &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/fabwags-basketball-ab8a.pdf#cook&quot;&gt;fabway stone&lt;/a&gt;  6. High-yield and junk bonds, and the mutual funds that hold them, might outperform at some point soon in the cycle. They behave differently from other fixed income because their prices are affected much more by credit quality. Defaults decline in stronger economic times, which boosts their market price and total return. They fell sharply with the rest of the bond market. But it boosted yields from all-time lows of 5 percent to a more attractive average of more than 6.5 percent.
