The 71-year-old Hollywood legend had long eschewed ties to the role that turned him into an A-lister, but is now expected to join Hamill and Fisher in reprising their roles for director J.J. Abramsâ upcoming âStar Wars: Episode VII.â

The jewish law, as mentioned in the article, says life does not exist until the first breath. They get this from the Torah, also known as the old testament in the Bible. I get that most christians do not read their Bible and all, but seriously. The Bible is pretty clear that life begins at the first breath. An all knowing God would not make this claim back then if it was not important for the future. It is apparently important right now when defining life. Which God already did. All of you satanic Christians that do not like God&apos;s rules need to go back to worship your master satan who has deceived you into not reading your Bible and believing that life begins at conception. Damn satanist! Go read your Bible and quit putting words in God&apos;s mouth like lucifer wants.
