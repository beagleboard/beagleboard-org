    <body>History &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/lamictal-discontinuation-schedule-f2ef.pdf&quot;&gt;lamictal uses bipolar&lt;/a&gt;  Malcolm has been a staff writer at The New Yorker magazine since the 1960s, where one of her special sleights of hand is to take dead, often endlessly reworked, subjects and investigate them with a rigour more closely associated with true crime. Anton Chekhov, Sylvia Plath, Sigmund Freud: in each of these cases she has found people to interview, places to go, and documents to scour, lending them the eye of a critic, the tone of a novelist and the energy of an old-fashioned gumshoe. A new collection of essays, Forty-One False Starts, takes its title from a New Yorker profile of the painter David Salle, and contains essays on other artists and writers, and a telling fragment from a memoir Malcolm abandoned.
