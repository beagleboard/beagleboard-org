Several kilometers away, a computer is listening. Within a minute, that song will be posted online, and the species of the frog will be identified &amp;#8212; all without scientists lifting a finger.

It does not make sense what we do in this country to continue to cater to this cult and persistently make excuses for and live in denial of the danger that it poses to all of us despite the overwhelming evidence that we read and hear daily.
