    <body>I enjoy travelling &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/stmap_213a0.html?duloxetine.kamagra.cialis&quot;&gt;when is methotrexate given by injection&lt;/a&gt;  So, what difference will she make to the life of this little boy, whose destiny was determined from the moment of conception? It is instructive to compare two photographs, both taken in 1982. First, there is the picture of Princess Diana at William&amp;rsquo;s christening. Surrounded by the world&amp;rsquo;s most alarming in-laws, the new mother is desperately trying to quiet the squally baby in her arms by sticking her little finger in his hungry mouth. Diana looks flustered under her pink brimmed hat, but there is no indication of concern on the part of the Queen or the Queen Mother. For the Windsors, babies are something that nannies deal with, to be presented to one after bathtime. (The Queen was apparently bemused at Balmoral that Diana preferred to do everything for baby William herself, when there were staff to do it for her.)
