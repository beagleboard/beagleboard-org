Secondly, the article is considered leftist because it is emphasizing the importance of luck instead of other factors. There&apos;s nothing scientific or measurable about &apos;luck&apos; on a macro scale, it is simply conjecture. So why mention luck anyway? Why not write about something more concrete and measurable?

This article is really political advocacy in disguise, and I know most of you are smart enough to see it.

Yes, he says, athletes are treated unfairly. He also says that 99% of the people who watch college sports donât care. âThey just want State U to go 10-1.â
