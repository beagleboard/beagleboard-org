Journalists and analysts try to make connections that they are not qualified to make. And they stretch reality. &amp;#8220;Housing starts down on Syria woes.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Housing starts rise on new iPhone 5S sales, QE easing.&amp;#8221; Huh? It&amp;#8217;s almost like an algorithm writes this fleeting crap.

Surely, no married female member of Congress who texted graphic photos of her crotch to young men would be forgiven for the act. And if a married female governor disappeared for five days to see her lover &amp;ndash; lying about where she was &amp;ndash; well, it&apos;s hard to see her getting elected to Congress after resigning the state office, as happened with Sanford.
