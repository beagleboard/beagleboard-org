What it was was a grab bag: covers of traditional country and folk tunes and songs by some of Dylanâs more-or-less contemporaries, including Paul Simon and Gordon Lightfoot, plus a few originals and several more revamped versions of older Dylan songs, including âLike a Rolling Stone,â from a 1969 concert with the Band. He also threw in sincere if slightly corny versions of Rodgers and Hartâs âBlue Moonâ and âLet It Be Me,â a bombastic French song that had been a hit for the Everly Brothers with English lyrics. Here and there, adding strings and such, the album has an old-fashioned pop sheen, the sort of sounds Dylan might have heard listening to radio growing up in Minnesota in the 1940s and 50sâwhich, in the context of 1970, is maybe the most radical statement Dylan has ever made, no longer preaching to the converted. Itâs no surprise he has since confessed a fondness for Frank Sinatra, Bobby Vee, and Ricky Nelson, among other singers who never played the Newport Folk Festival.

If this isn&apos;t a classic piece of &quot;journalistic&quot; waste! I wonder who comes up with this stuff! This falls under the proverbial &quot;duh&quot; category... which contains about everything NBC has to write these days...
