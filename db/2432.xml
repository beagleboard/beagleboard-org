Like the one about the Mouse, the Bird, and the Sausage (and no, they don&apos;t walk into a bar). Why not? What about these tales didn&apos;t quite capture the imagination the way the others did? Here, in no particular order, are some of the weirder, more bizarre, and odd Grimms&apos; tales that didn&apos;t quite merit the Disney treatment &amp;mdash; you be the judge.
