    <body>We were at school together &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/alphamedicalcentercom-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;yinopharma-heparin.com&lt;/a&gt;  In 2012, the 88-win Tigers went directly into the best-of-five ALDS because they won the awful Central division, while the 93-win Orioles and 93-win Rangers had to play in the one-game wild-card playoff (and the 90-win Rays and 89-win Angels were completely left out of the postseason). That&apos;s not right, and it&apos;s easily correctable. I don&apos;t believe the wild-card teams (ideally, in a division-free setup, teams finishing with the fourth- and fifth-best records in the league) should be on equal footing, as was essentially the case during the one-wild-card-team era.
