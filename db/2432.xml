Over the past week the Dow Jones Index has gained nearly 2 and a half percent. The Nasdaq is up more than 3%. Oil prices fell to around $107 a barrel for light sweet crude. The Standard &amp; Poor&amp;#8217;s 500 index had its sixth straight gain yesterday, the longest winning streak since July. But the market has improved only recently as stocks set new highs in early August. The high-technology-dominated Nasdaq index is now at its highest level in 13 years.
