Darkness had fallen in a city where many streetlights hadn&apos;t come on since Hurricane Katrina. The fog was thick. I was by myself. A car turned off Broad, bypassed the pumps, and drove up close to me. The driver opened the door and stood up and asked for directions to an address on Veterans Boulevard. Veterans was so far from where we stood I feared I was being set up. Then he walked around his door and toward me.
