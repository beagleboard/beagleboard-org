Iâm slightly concussed, just a little, mildly,â Romine said. âIâve had one before, so I know what to expect. Itâs not as bad as I thought. I got up this morning and was able to move around. I wasnât sensitive to light. Iâm pretty sharp still, as sharp as I can be.â

That was the era when Muhammad Ali refused to serve in the Vietnam War, leading to a ban from boxing, because he couldn&apos;t see &quot;why we and other so-called Negroes go 10,000 miles to drop bombs and bullets on other innocent brown people who&apos;s never bothered us.&quot;

Here&apos;s the truth: Manning wasn&apos;t going any place other than Denver. The reason? At that time ( and still mostly true today) the AFC West was basically an all-girls highschool league. This pretty much gauranteed a significant number of wins within the division and no competition for the divisional title. Furthermore the home games are played at Mile High whose elevation confers an an additional advantage to the home team. I&apos;m sure Elway patiently explained these issues to Manning several times until Manning fully understood the implications of these facts.
