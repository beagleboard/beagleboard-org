Her voice-over career is part hand-me-down, part gift. Her father Sam (Fred Melamed, whose velvety tones stood out in a supporting role in âA Serious Manâ) is a legend in this small, idiosyncratic wing of the business. Carolâs sister Dani (Michaela Watkins), a hotel employee, and her mensch husband (Rob Corddry, always welcome) get a kick out of Carol. She shleps and sputters and has a sweetly disheveled lack of focus.

But Mr Miliband was adamant that after years of price rises the gas and power giants could afford it. âThe companies wonât like it because it will cost them money,â he said in a speech delivered without notes to a packed hall in Brighton.

Video footage posted online, purportedly showing the aftermath of the bombing, showed four victims who had been thrown from the bus by the force of the explosion.

Then, it was a case of looking for authentic recipes from cookbooks and letters of the time to see what kind of food Austen was envisaging, and updating them to suit modern kitchens and tastes: few people these days, after all, know what a &quot;peck of flour&quot; is.
