    <body>In tens, please (ten pound notes) &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/stmap_93920.html?cialis.penisole.caduet&quot;&gt;helix original&lt;/a&gt;  Eli Manning is having a terrible season and has already thrown 15 interceptions, as many as he had last year. Itâs okay for Giants fans to be disappointed in him, but his two Super Bowl MVPs do earn him some benefit of the doubt. I doubt heâs going to play like this all season. The pass to wide-open tight end Brandon Myers when the Giants were driving for the winning touchdown at the end of the Bears game was too high and intercepted when it deflected off Myersâ hands. Manning had enough time and a clear passing lane that should have allowed him to drill it between the numbers â but it was not an uncatchable ball. Then again, if Jerry Reese had re-signed Martellus Bennett, who is 6-6, and didnât bring in Myers, who is 6-3, the ball would have been right on the money.
