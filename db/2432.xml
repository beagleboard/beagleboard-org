    <body>Where&apos;s the postbox? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/taneycohealthorg-bac9.pdf#alcohol&quot;&gt;medcitipharmacy.com&lt;/a&gt;  That&amp;rsquo;s how I found myself 20 miles into a cycle ride around the route taken by the English army, standing by the 1910 battlefield monument and staring at a field of pinkish plough as it swept up to a wide ridge. You can do the same thing with the Scottish army&amp;rsquo;s route north of the border, or you could join both routes together and cycle for a few days. Several bike hire companies are involved and there are excellent route maps. In the end, though, you will find yourself staring up at that ridge near the little village of Branxton, trying to imagine the events of September 9 1513 and the realities of 10,000 dead and dying men.
