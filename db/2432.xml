Keeping your dog active and managing your own life can present quite a challenge, however. Dog daycare and dog parks are a great way to keep your dog active with minimal effort required on your part. You can even work while your dog plays in both situations, just be sure to keep one eye on your pooch at the dog park as sometimes things can get a bit rowdy.
