    <body>Could I borrow your phone, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://teerandaz.com/stmap_131c0.html?vilitra.viagra.diabecon.protonix&quot;&gt;generique trandate&lt;/a&gt;  That was a great discussion on tariffs. I agree that some small amount of tariffs should be put in place in certain sectors. They are not the only problem nor solution though. How do you put a tariff on a call center? Computer programming? Can you put a tariff on a technology R&amp;D center? In fact, there are many problems that require many solutions. I believe Mr. El-Erian is eluding to the fact that there are large social changes afoot. We can&amp;#8217;t just cut American middle class life styles to match those of other nations. We would have open rebellion if that occurred. We also can&amp;#8217;t continue to be so far ahead of the developing countries, or they will rebel. As I mentioned in my previous post, if we continue on the path we&amp;#8217;re on America will reduce it&amp;#8217;s standard of living somewhat and the developing countries will continue to raise theirs. In a short time, perhaps another decade, the bumps will be ironed out. If you look at standards of living in a line chart, the American middle class is a bump in the line.
