    <body>Pleased to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/lek-prostamol-uno-6a83.pdf&quot;&gt;lek prostamol uno&lt;/a&gt;  If we look at other diseases, such as alcoholism or mental illness, we can easily see how these groups struggled before their illnesses were classified as a disease. Obesity has often been labeled with statements such as, &quot;You should eat less and exercise more,&quot; or &quot;It&apos;s your fault. Take some responsibility.&quot; But the &quot;personal responsibility&quot; argument for obesity is ineffective. There is personal responsibility in all aspects of life. For years, this same label was applied to alcoholism and drug addiction; however, today, we clearly take these issues very seriously and treat them as diseases.
