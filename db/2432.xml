Ultimately, consumers must recognize that $3 T-shirts have a human cost. Retailers who make money on the backs of dead and injured workers must value the rights of their employees and agree to be held accountable for tragedies that occur in their supply chains. Instead of vilifying unions, corporations must recognize them as a legitimate way for employees to protect their rights. Through it all, workers who rise up for a collective vision of dignity and justice are the lynchpin that supports any long-lasting change.
