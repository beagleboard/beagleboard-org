In 1952, he was convicted of &apos;gross indecency&apos; with another man and was forced to undergo chemical castration. His security privileges were also withdrawn meaning he could no longer work for the UK Government Communications Headquarters. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41.

Such transactions may contain data that is wholly unrelated to the tasked selector, including the full content of discrete communications that are not to, from or about the facility tasked for collection.&quot; The NSA &quot;lacks confidence in the effectiveness of such measures t [editor&apos;s note: the filters it uses to screen for US persons communications] as applied to Internet transactions.&quot; The NSA and the Court engaged in a colloquy of sorts as NSA tried figured out the precise nature and scope of the problem. When the Justice Department and ODNI applied for a re-certification of the FISA 702 collection, the Court said no. The NSA&apos;s revelations had &quot;fundamentally altered its understanding of the scope of the collection pursurant to Section 702 and requires careful rexamination of the many of the assumptions and presumptions&quot; underlying its previous orders.

In the 1970s, Hochmair and Clark of the cochlear implant company MED-EL in Innsbruck, Austria, and the University of Melbourne, respectively, were the first to insert multiple electrodes into the human cochlea to stimulate nerves that respond to different frequencies of sound. Wilson, now at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, later refined the technology with a strategy known as âcontinuous interleaved samplingâ (CIS), which allowed the implants to process speech clearly. CIS continues to be the most effective way to translate acoustic information into electrical signals that the brain can interpret, says otolaryngologist Debara Tucci, who with Wilson co-directs the Duke Hearing Center. Before modern implants, âpatients were really terrifiedâ at the prospect of deafness, she says. These contributions have âchanged the lives of thousands and thousands of people for the better.â

Instead, two damaging second-half interceptions by Smith â what is it with the New York quarterbacks this season? â deep in Pittsburgh territory destroyed any chance the Jets had to build on the positive vibes they created in Atlanta.
