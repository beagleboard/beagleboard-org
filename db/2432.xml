He was mad as hell. We finally resolved everything by giving him a contract extension, but even that didnât go too well. He was going on, saying how heâd won nearly 300 games and could lose 100 games in a row and still be over .500, and I suddenly said: âYeah, but you havenât won anything for us!â At that point he charged across the room and I thought he was going to kill me.â

The Cavs are not assured that this move will be a success, but in contrast to the Sixers last season, they are assured it will not completely blow up in their faces. As it pertains to Bynum, those odds are probably as good as you&amp;#8217;re going to get.
