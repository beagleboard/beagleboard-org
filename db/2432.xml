    <body>A company car &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikasafloors.com/pharmacie-frorg-bdec.pdf#concrete&quot;&gt;pharmacie-fr.org forum&lt;/a&gt;  Detroit became the biggest American city to file for bankruptcy after its emergency manager filed for Chapter 9 protection on July 18 with more than $18 billion in accrued obligations. In the filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr indicated that the city&apos;s estimated number of creditors was &quot;over 100,000.&quot; Orr, who was hired in March to assist with the city&apos;s budget, had tried to convince creditors to accept pennies on the dollar to deal with its financial problems.
