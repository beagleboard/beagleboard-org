Hate crime laws should be abolished. What does it matter if someone dislikes you (and in turn commits a crime against you) because of your skin color, gender, age, political affiliation, something you did/said to them, or any other reason? A criminal act is a criminal act no matter what scope you view it through. All these laws seem to do is stir up controversy, divisiveness, and biased speculation. The punishable act is the crime, not the motivation. Hate crime laws are just a byproduct of political correctness and thought policing run amok. While they may have been well intentioned, they are not the answer to solving these problems. If we want to stop the &quot;hate&quot; we need to change people&apos;s mentalities, not try to tack on extra punishment for someone who has a different perspective.
