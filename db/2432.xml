They need to be market-facing initiativeswhere the government provides the framework and then stepsaway,&quot; Sinha said. &quot;If the government starts to play an activerole ... my issue is that it will be very slow, and there willbe lots of implementation hurdles that we&apos;ll face.&quot; (Additional reporting by Jatindra Dash in BHUBANESWAR; Editingby John Chalmers and Ed Davies)
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/beta-pharma-technologies-sl-a6a4.pdf&quot;&gt;beta pharma technologies&lt;/a&gt;  I&apos;ve spent almost my entire career as a journalist covering tech in and around Silicon Valley, meeting entrepreneurs, executives and engineers, watching companies rise and fall (or in the case of Apple, rise, fall and rise again) and attending confabs and conferences. Before joining Forbes in February 2012, I had a very brief stint in corporate communications at HP (on purpose) and worked for more than six years on the tech team at Bloomberg News, where I dived into the financial side of tech. Before that, I was Silicon Valley bureau chief for Interactive Week, a contributor to Wired and Upside, and a reporter and news editor for MacWeek. The first computer game I ever played was Zork, my collection of now-vintage tech T-shirts includes a tie-dye BMUG classic and a HyperCard shirt featuring a dog and fire hydrant. When I can work at home, I settle into the black Herman Miller Aeron chair that I picked up when NeXT closed its doors. You can email me at cguglielmo@forbes.com.
