They have the darkest surfaces of any object in the solar system. In fact, Comet Halley, being a very old comet, is so dark it reflects only about four percent of the light that bathes it. I can&amp;rsquo;t stress enough how dark that is. A little quick research revealed that asphalt reflects seven percent of the light it receives! For those of you who live around New England, think about the snow on the side of the road in mid- to late-March. It&amp;rsquo;s full of sand, dirt and small rocks.
