He already has come back two times this season, arguably too soon, indisputably too hard. He has a strained quad muscle now, looking at another week or two of rest. He reportedly wasnât at the game on Saturday because of a stomach bug, yet another annoyance. It is left to Brian Cashman and Joe Girardi to preach common sense to a star who has always floated ethereally above such earthly matters. If he wants to stick around, he will need to come back to Earth, join the mortals.
