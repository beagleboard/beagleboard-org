    <body>Until August &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/catuaba-bark-extract-women-6ae3.pdf&quot;&gt;online order catuaba bark&lt;/a&gt;  Huh. I have been a fan of Damon&apos;s activist stance and this is a disappointing reveal. And it IS typical among many proclaimed progressives, at least those I know, and that&apos;s a large part of what holds back widespread school improvement. I&apos;m not a big fan of charters or even magnets as they currently exist, though I see their value and accept they are unlikely to disappear. I do think they could be more equitably administered, and I&apos;d support them much more if they were. I chose to send my daughter to a declining-on-paper neighborhood public school and don&apos;t regret it a bit; about to &quot;graduate&quot; to junior high, she&apos;s thriving socially and academically in the high poverty school, where the majority of kids don&apos;t share her skin color. Whatever. I&apos;ve always openly reserved my right to send my daughter wherever I felt she needed to be, but I strongly believe in transforming &quot;failing&quot; neighborhood schools into a positive choice among the many in the landscape. The only way for that to happen, to beat back the leeches and scammers, is for the community to participate - if you want to build local control, especially where schools are concerned, the only way is to take on the challenge it presents, directly - that is, in my view, without corporatist intervention/profiteers. I ran our PTO for years and recently ran a fellow parent&apos;s successful school board campaign. There are victories and failures, it&apos;s a slow process and frustrating to endure the common naysayers&apos; perception of traditional publics while engaging in the fight to improve them. Sure, &quot;choice&quot; is good, but I know few who wouldn&apos;t want to be able to use the local school and eliminate the chaotic, desperate consumerism of public education we&apos;re all saddled with now; to avoid the tests, segregation and insane application processes that have become its hallmarks. Seeing that my kid AND my community&apos;s children (because that affects my family too) are properly educated is too important to me. It&apos;s not a consumer experience for me, it&apos;s a civic duty that would be irresponsible to shirk. It&apos;s been the most genuinely progressive experience of my life, and the process is certainly passing those values on to my child in a way a theoretical progressive could never, in my opinion. Too bad Mr. Damon missed such a simple truth - actions speak louder than words. Tsk.

I didn&apos;t want to text him when I thought about it. I didn&apos;t want to jinx it.&quot;
