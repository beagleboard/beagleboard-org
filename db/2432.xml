    <body>Will I have to work shifts? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.layeredonline.com/cyclophosphamide-cytoxan-chemotherapeutic-agent-dd54.pdf&quot;&gt;cyclophosphamide order sheet&lt;/a&gt;  The brutal politics and financial weakness of the Labour Party were made plain when Kenny endorsed Ed Miliband. He implied that if Ed did not win then GMB would withdraw its money from Labour. It was a bluff but it was also the moment at which Ed&amp;rsquo;s campaign became deadly serious. Last year, the union which gives Â£1.4million to Labour a year openly attacked Ed for the first time over his support of a public sector pay freeze. After Ed Miliband announced reform to the links between Labour and the Unions, Kenny warned him Labour could lose up to 90 per cent of their funding.
