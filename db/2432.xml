    <body>I&apos;d like to open a business account &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/mcpbhealthcom-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;ep-med.org&lt;/a&gt;  What a bunch of idiot simpletons. The Queen and the Royal Family are in large part the reason why London is becoming the most visited city on earth (expected to overtake Bangkok in 2014) with 16 million foreign tourists. Income derived from these foreign tourists far exceeds the Queen&apos;s income or expenses with all of her so admired palaces, castles, pageantry and tradition. This is what the tourist comes to see rain or shine. Taxes generated from these foreign visitors is vast compared to the expense of having an unbiased head of state who represents the people and not some money grabbing political cause. Grow up you bunch of winging republicans look back in history and learn from earlier times.

The welcome given to Lord Justice Munby&amp;rsquo;s draft guidelines to answer &amp;ldquo;the charge that we have a system of secret and unaccountable justice&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; entitled &amp;ldquo;Transparency in the Family Courts (and Court of Protection)&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; came from two opposing directions. On one side, two newspapers proclaimed it as a victory for their own campaigns to open up our family courts to greater public scrutiny. On the other was one of the chief cheerleaders for the system, Sir Martin Narey, now Michael Gove&amp;rsquo;s chief adviser on childcare, who wrote an article for The Times, &amp;ldquo;Family courts don&amp;rsquo;t take enough children into care&amp;rdquo;. The new &amp;ldquo;transparency&amp;rdquo;, he argued, would enable the public to see how desperately needed is the vital work our courts and social workers are doing.
