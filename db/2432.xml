After starting the year at just over 1.75%, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond rose to just more than 2.05% in March before declining through early May, reaching its low for the year at 1.63% on May 2nd. They have been on an upward trajectory since, accelerating after Bernanke&apos;s testimony and reaching 2.88% on August 19th. Much of the rise in yields has been due to concern that the Fed will taper its purchase of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as soon as next month and that it may end its purchases as early as next spring.
