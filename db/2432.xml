    <body>What&apos;s the interest rate on this account? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/midatech-pharma-stock-price-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;midatech pharma stock&lt;/a&gt;  The game&amp;#8217;s over-the-top animations and art style have garnered most of the headlines so far. The art direction of Dragon&amp;#8217;s Crown is one of excess. It features unrealistic body proportions for some of its male and female characters, and it won&amp;#8217;t take long to get a big dose of it upon firing the game up for the first time. And by it, I mean breasts. Giant bouncing breasts in Dragon&amp;#8217;s Crown are a thing. Are they too big? Do they oversexualize the game? Do they objectify women? I don&amp;#8217;t know if they do or not. Probably for some people, you could definitely make a case for it, but it&amp;#8217;s art nonetheless. If this is the sort of thing that will either embarass you or enrage you, you should probably pass on Dragon&amp;#8217;s Crown. But you&amp;#8217;d be missing one hell of a genre-bending mash-up, the likes of which hasn&amp;#8217;t been seen in a long time.
