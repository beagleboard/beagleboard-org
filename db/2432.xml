    <body>I&apos;m training to be an engineer &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/sildalis-uk-69bc.pdf&quot;&gt;sildalis uk&lt;/a&gt;  Mr. Kennedy pointed out in his speech that the &quot;lack of an adequate education denies the Negro a chance to get a decent job,&quot; He said that Negro students who have attended segregated schools have &quot;suffered a loss which can never be restored.&quot; But &amp;ndash; if this be true, why have so many Negroes, in the North and the South, who have attended predominantly Negro schools and colleges been able to attain high positions in the business and professional world, while other Negroes who were educated in &quot;integrated&quot; schools failed? Is a person&apos;s success or failure in life dependent only on his schooling? Must we not realistically examine the worth of the individual himself?
