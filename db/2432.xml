I am too old and too poor to listen to the junk ads and business come-ons that fuel the doddering and fraudulent economy of this not so great nation and getting smaller all the time while it&amp;#8217;s self inflating and, very frequently, bought with advertising dollars, puffs everything from politics to pampers. But when it puffs war it is a crime against humanity. It is murder for hire. It is paid for propaganda for the sake of converting some man&amp;#8217;s blood into another man&amp;#8217;s treasure. They preach a work ethic but don&amp;#8217;t really mean it. They know that talk is for the suckers and anyone who can, builds a big pile of cash, anyway they can, and sits of it. They then spend inordinately amounts of time and money congratulating themselves on their bravery and hard work. People never tire of building gilded railings around their lives.
