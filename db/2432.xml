    <body>An estate agents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/where-can-i-buy-generic-clomid-5168.pdf#prevented&quot;&gt;ovulation prescription clomid&lt;/a&gt;  As a writer, one is aware of a need for wit, originality of thought and, in this age of social media, a degree of acceptance of a changing world. And yet it strikes me that the qualities needed to get on in life and enjoy it, without turning into a cynical pessimist or a wide-eyed Pollyanna, are the same as ever they were. I offer them here, not as ground-breaking shafts of wisdom, but as things that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe in over almost 50 years of gainful employment in a workplace that can be scary and challenging but also hugely rewarding and &amp;ndash; on occasion &amp;ndash; uplifting.
