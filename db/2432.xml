    <body>I didn&apos;t go to university &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/nmb-generics-pharmacy-b01a.pdf&quot;&gt;do you need a prescription for online pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  President Obama is very happy with the federal government status quo: ever-rising spending; continuing giant fiscal deficits; nonstop major increments to its debt; zero reform of the entitlement programs (which have many $tens of trillions in unfunded liabilities between them); and excessive regulation of the economy by federal agencies, including through the enactment of Obamacare &amp;#8211; a poorly designed law that most U.S. citizens don&amp;#8217;t want. The nation needs a reform of the federal government so that it doesn&amp;#8217;t continue to overburden its economy. If President Obama and the Democrats won&amp;#8217;t negotiate, fine. Reducing spending by shutting down the government is clumsy, but for a time might well be a good thing. The status quo is dysfunctional.
