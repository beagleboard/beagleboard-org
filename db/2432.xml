He addressed the team one day in training camp last year and again before its Monday night game against the Texans in Week 5. The Jets were coming off an embarrassing 34-0 loss to the 49ers at home a week earlier. Although Davis was used sparingly up to that point, he didnât hesitate to speak up.
