    <body>perfect design thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/stmap_7ef00.html?levothroid.amiloride.tacrolimus.cialis&quot;&gt;deluxe vs original proextender&lt;/a&gt;  Not a chance, Comcast (or Time Warner or AT&amp;T). The Great Recession forced Americans to finally clue up to how awful and predatory all those media giants are (Comcast is GE/NBC-Universal). It&amp;#8217;s been a decade since Comcast has been able to NOT screw up customer accounts, fail to correct their mistakes &amp;#8211; even as they admit it is Comcast at fault, arbitrarily jack up services, as well as surreptitiously slap services not ordered onto billing that never gets fixed. That&amp;#8217;s why the customer retention is in the toilet. What a racket. More and more Americans are cutting the cable, opting for free over air broadcast channels and internet-only service for streaming &amp;#8211; often for free, as more devices are capable of all-in-one HD delivery. It isn&amp;#8217;t because people don&amp;#8217;t want cable tv, though most people I know simply refuse to pay for 250 channels wherein 230 are pure garbage, latino, religious, or shoutin&amp;#8217; head so-called news. It&amp;#8217;s also because they HATE the cable companies THAT much. Customers will hate them just as much when their security system gets screwed up in the same way&amp;#8230; with wayyy higher life issues at stake. Wait till Comcast makes a mistake and retaliates by flipping a switch and shutting down your cable phone/wi-fi service on which the security system works. Life&amp;#8217;s both too short and too precious to put your family into the hands of these corrupt corporate bozos. That&amp;#8217;s why they&amp;#8217;re trying to lock people into the same kind of 2-year contract the telcoms do on cell phone service. No thanks.

The sanctions have hit the countryâs economy hard, decimating its vital oil exports and blocking transactions on international banking networks.
