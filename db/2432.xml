U.S. authorities did not know the date, the timing or the target of the planned attack, it said.

But, he&apos;s not taking anything by the way of welfare like a lot of others, who are just as poor by choice. If you look at it like, he just wants to live life and enjoy it, within his means, that that should be o.k.. Then, you look at the poor who want to be poor because they know the government will take care of them. Give them food to eat and a house to live in. There are those who claim a disability, who haven&apos;t one. These people are the poor by choice too, they just don&apos;t want to live by their own means, they want us to pay for them!
