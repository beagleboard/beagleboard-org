Retaining him was a no-brainer for the Clippers, and the only real question here is how Paul&amp;#8217;s surgically-repaired knee will hold up over the course of the deal. Paul missed 12 games and played a career-low 33.4 minutes per game last season, and a five-year extension will carry him through his age-32 season. There&amp;#8217;s no guarantee that Paul will make it to the end of his deal in full health but that risk is barely worth a second thought to the Clippers, who have seen Paul transform their status as a perennial also-ran into a fringe championship contender during his two seasons in L.A.

Both Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler, considered the cornerstone of the franchiseâs future rotation, are coming up on strict innings limits. To prepare them for next year, however, the Mets want to limit their workload, but space it out so they work until the end of the season. Adding an experienced starter will allow the Mets to do that.
