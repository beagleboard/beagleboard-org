After 11 years together, the former Spice Girl is engaged to longtime beau Jade Jones, a former boy band singer-turned-chef. The singer made the announcement to her colleagues during a commercial break on U.K.&apos;s &apos;Dancing on Ice&apos; Sunday night, according to the Daily Mail. Bunton, who is a judge on the competition TV show, flashed her massive diamond engagement ring to the cameras once the show returned to the air.
