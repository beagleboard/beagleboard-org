Eventually, they stopped at the chamber&amp;#8217;s lowest setting, around minus 120 Fahrenheit â &amp;#8220;a warm summer&amp;#8217;s day on Mars,&amp;#8221; Cziczo says.

You have a market stall and you go out and buy 100 kilos of bananas. You now have exposure to bananas. Your &apos;view&apos; is that you can sell those bananas for a profit.
