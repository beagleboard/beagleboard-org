In the UK, 70 percent of all housework is done by women and still nearly two-thirds of all housework is done by women even if they work over 30 hours per week. In Greece, over 80 percent of all housework is done by women and for those women working 30 hours or more per week, more than three quarters of them still have responsibility for household chores.
