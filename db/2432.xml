The main quest, however, is a solo pursuit. In terms of structure and gameplay, X &amp; Y is largely more of the same, but with a few key alterations. You are a youngster that has moved into a new town, when one day you receive a letter from a local Pokemon professor inviting you to adopt a Pokemon and travel the world to fill the &amp;lsquo;Pokedex&amp;rsquo; by capturing and battling different Pokemon, beat the eight gym leaders (essentially end of chapter bosses) and enlighten yourself along the way. It&amp;rsquo;s a coming of age story, essentially, with the saccharine beginnings of a jolly jaunt giving way to harsher challenges along the way.
