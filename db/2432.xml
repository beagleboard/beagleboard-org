They show up. They play their assigned roles. They send nice notes and lend comfort to the bereaved in that warm and open-faced Clinton way. They are here with empathetic eyes to pay respects, like heads of Mafia families do when a rival godfather falls.

It reminds me too much of a consumer society. A shopping list of holidays and sights and sensations. It&amp;#039;s not about being alive, it&amp;#039;s about going through the motions.&quot;
