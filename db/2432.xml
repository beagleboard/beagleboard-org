Their veteran presence will be desperately needed, though, as the Jets hope to turn a weak pass-rushing unit into a strength. The Jets ranked 23rd in the NFL last year by averaging one sack per 17.8 dropbacks. Any chance of a turnaround rests on Coples and Davis playing up to their 2012 draft stock and Barnes rediscovering the pass-rushing form that allowed him to rack up 11 sacks for the Chargers in 2011. Bellore and Mauga are special teams standouts while McIntyre established himself as an NFL-caliber player last year after bouncing around professional football since 2006.
