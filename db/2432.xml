    <body>I&apos;m doing a masters in law &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/dermajeun-cost-a511.pdf&quot;&gt;dermajeun cost&lt;/a&gt;  Eagle-eyed readers may note the maximum towing capacity of the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel is 9200 lb. On-paper, that&apos;s one ton less than the maximum rating for a Ford F-150 equipped with an EcoBoost V-6. Some buyers may see the capability gap as a weakness or shortcoming of the light-duty diesel drivetrain compared to the Ford. Cairns disagrees, saying that the line between light-duty and HD trucks has been blurred within the last few years. He blames that on competitors&apos; marketing departments. &quot;We do a lot of customer surveys and clinics. The light-duty (1500) customers are not asking for more payload or more towing. They consider all of the Detroit Three&apos;s half-tons essentially the same in terms of capability. The EcoDiesel will tow what a half-ton customer needs to tow. I&apos;ve said consistently for years, if you have a 10,000-lb or bigger trailer, you should be getting an HD truck, it&apos;s a tool made for the job. I think the target customer will recognize what a half-ton truck is made for, which is a towing range of 5000-7000 lb.&quot;

The yellow areas, he added, âwhere we are currently improving slowly, would immediately start to diffuse and be unsustainable. And then if itâs red, we havenât started it yet.â
