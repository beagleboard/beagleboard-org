FT only makes sense in very specific scenarios and given the limitation of only one vCPU (one runaway process can hang the whole server), there are also several other restrictions (see bit.ly/M5vS6 for specific details). Furthermore, FT only protects against hardware failure -- if a software problem occurs, that problem will be dutifully replicated to other VMs. A decade ago, building reliable hardware platforms was difficult and the most common cause of server failure was hardware. Today, the situation is quite different, with software issues being blamed as the main culprit.
