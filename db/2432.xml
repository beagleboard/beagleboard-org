Juanita recalled: &amp;ldquo;I was an unwanted brat .&amp;rdquo; She was dressed and treated as a boy , and confined to a separate wing of the house. Her governess, Isabel Rutt (whom she called &amp;ldquo;the Rutt&amp;rdquo;), was often ordered by Juanita&amp;rsquo;s father to strip her naked and beat her; aged 15, and after one particularly frenzied beating, Juanita left home to live with an uncle, saying she had no wish to grow up &amp;ldquo;like the rest of that Happy Valley lot&amp;rdquo;.
