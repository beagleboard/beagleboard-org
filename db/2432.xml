Its version of 311, Citizens Connect, uploads all open service requests to a Twitter feed and posts updates when cases are closed.

The âCity Workerâ app assigns service requests to government employees while they are in the field and allows them to close out cases without ever returning to the office. Service requests are directly routed to the nearest work crew from the appropriate department, automatically and efficiently assigning responsibility.
