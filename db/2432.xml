Richard Hansen of the corps said more gates along various canals could be closed, and warned boaters not to get caught on the wrong side of those gates &quot;If there is a gate in the system, it may not be open when you decide to come back in,&quot; Hansen said. &quot;So it&apos;s time to pull your boats out of the water and quit fishing.&quot;
