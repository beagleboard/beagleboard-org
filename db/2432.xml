Young, 29, was best known for his leading role in the Disney series &quot;The Famous Jett Jackson.&quot; He was found unresponsive by Los Angeles cops conducting a welfare check about 9 a.m. after reportedly missing a call time on the set of the TNT police drama &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles,&quot; the source said. Investigators believe Young took his own life, the celebrity website TMZ.com reported.
