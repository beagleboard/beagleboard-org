Such an S-bend would, said Rod, give pleasing movement to a picture. It looked all the better for having a foreground rock to lead the eye into the photograph. As light rain returned we were experimenting with settings for depth of field, seeing how much of a shot could remain acceptably in focus by changing the aperture size. My otherwise very serviceable bridge camera had limitations here; the smallest aperture I could set being F11, whereas Rod&amp;rsquo;s DSLR camera had a range up to F22.
