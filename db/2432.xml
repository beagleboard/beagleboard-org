    <body>Where do you come from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/stmap_6ae30.html?cialis.ponstel.astelin.zocor&quot;&gt;kamagra thailand kaufen&lt;/a&gt;  Of course, I am lucky enough to be able to spend my spare time doing work experience. I am fortunate that I can still live at my parents&apos; home making this affordable. By the end of this calendar year I will have completed 14 weeks of internships and work experience over the twelve months, not including the 40  hours a week I put into my student newspaper, and the half a year I spent working part-time as a waitress. Although I know I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly fortunate to have the chance to do all of this, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but shake the feeling of being outperformed at every turn by a generation of students who are exceptionally innovative, socially minded and enterprising. Dismayed by the conventional routes of finding a job, or perhaps unable to financially support themselves through the inevitable weeks of unpaid internships, they are forging their own path towards career success.
