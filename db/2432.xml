However, it also translates into people having less wealth to cope with the impacts of climate change. As a result, the Hopes estimate that the cost of carbon dioxide emissions is actually highest in the slowest economic growth scenarios. The average estimated cost also rises a bit in the highest economic growth scenarios, because these have the largest emissions and the most global warming. Even though people are richer in these scenarios and thus more able to cope with damages from climate change, the possibility of triggering extremely costly catastrophic climate change outweighs the GDP growth.
