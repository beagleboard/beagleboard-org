    <body>I&apos;d like to send this parcel to  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/ab-doer-twist-dvd-for-sale-6865.pdf#publcation&quot;&gt;ab doer twist dvd for sale&lt;/a&gt;  It was supposed to be the kickoff to a stock frenzy, and shares were supposed to soar to the heavens right out of the gate, but instead all heck broke loose. Trading on the first day was a mess, and in the months that followed investors found countless reasons to not &quot;like&quot; Facebook as a stock. By last September, the company&apos;s share price had been cut in half, trading below $18 a share. It looked as if Facebook and the entire social media space was going to be just another cautionary tale for investors.
