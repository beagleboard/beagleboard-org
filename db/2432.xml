These same swaggering qualities made the Old Etonian Ian Fleming cringe, which is how the name Goldfinger joined Blofeld in the Bond universe of caricature villains. Certainly, Goldfinger had a reputation for being difficult, but the day after we met, I received a book inscribed, &amp;ldquo;To my dear friend, Stephen, with affection EG&amp;rdquo;. I liked him a lot.

These current materials become unstable when they overheat or are packed too closely, placing limits on how much information can be written onto a hard drive. Skyrmions remain stable; even if they are moved around, their structure does not unravel. That means you could pack a disk surface with them more densely, potentially leading to a hard drive that can store 20 times more data.
