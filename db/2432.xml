The most efficient method is by first using a baited raft to ascertain its presence, then setting a cage trap baited with meat or anointed with mink lure, which mimics the scent emitted by the mink&amp;rsquo;s anal glands.

Smugglers put them in often rickety fishing boats or motorized rubber dinghies whose engines sometimes fail. Countless migrants drown or die of dehydration and their bodies are tossed overboard, according to survivors&apos; accounts.
