Yankees fans have to hope that the makeshift lineup that has carried the team thus far in the absence of both Jeter and Alex Rodriguez can continue to tread water as the aging stars continue to recover from injuries. If the old Yankees can get back on the field in the near future, this team is still in position to have a shot at the playoffs, however if they can&amp;#8217;t come back a run looks unlikely.
