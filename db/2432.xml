    <body>I&apos;ve got a very weak signal &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/cialis-ed-pack-92e2.pdf#rescue&quot;&gt;cialis generic cheapest&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8220;We believe that everybody has a heart and everybody has a chance for transformation,&amp;#8221; said Beth Waitkus, the director of the Insight Garden Program that started 10 years ago at San Quentin prison. &amp;#8220;What happens with gardening is &amp;#8230; they reconnect to themselves. They reconnect to their feelings. They reconnect to each other as a community, a small community in the prison, and they really reconnect to nature. And, I think that offers a huge opportunity for transformation when we reconnect to ourselves and to the natural world.&amp;#8221;
