I don&amp;#8217;t know yet. That&amp;#8217;s what this journey will be about. I think we are. I think we have a chance to do something. That excites me. If we can look at what&amp;#8217;s on paper and get that on the floor and keep it healthy, I think we can be a special team. That excites me.&amp;#8221;
