    <body>Enter your PIN &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/levothyroxine-medscape-e3c4.pdf&quot;&gt;levothyroxine medscape&lt;/a&gt;  You get the feeling Yankee fans understand this. Maybe itâs because the common fans have been priced out of the new Stadium, leaving the moated fortress to the privileged, dispassionate corporate millionaires and their equally privileged guests. Or maybe itâs because they were spoiled by the sustained excellence of Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, Paul OâNeill, Jorge Posada and Co. and simply canât relate to this present bunch, gritty as theyâve been despite the unfathomable spate of injuries that should have killed them off months ago. How else to explain the 10,000 empty seats Thursday night in what was the most important game of the year â against the Red Sox â and the general apathy in the stands until the Yankeesâ six-run rally in the seventh (when a lot of those fans had already left)?
