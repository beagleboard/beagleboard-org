    <body>Could I take your name and number, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://scvhealthyfuture.org/clomipramine-hydrochloride-side-effects.html&quot;&gt;anafranil dosage for dogs&lt;/a&gt;  So, why do you suppose the title of the poster is &amp;ldquo;Identification of subjects likely to respond&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; and yet they don&amp;rsquo;t tell us the actual percentage of disease mutations their &amp;ldquo;GLP HEK-amenable mutation assay&amp;rdquo; identified as being treatable by Migalastat? Why would they &amp;ldquo;guess&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s around 30% when they screened over 500 mutations and know what the number actually is? And why do you suppose they are claiming there are 5- to 10- fold more patients with this disease than there actually are, because their results indicate Migalastat is likely to treat most Fabry disease patients, or because it appears to be effective in only a small percentage of them? If Crowley had data saying that anywhere near 250 out of the 500 mutations they screened could be treated with Migalastat don&amp;rsquo;t you think he&amp;rsquo;d just say so, as opposed to never saying what the number actually is?
