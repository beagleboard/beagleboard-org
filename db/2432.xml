He paid attention to more than just the guy with the ball and he was more aware on the court. He also shot 12-of-23 and flashed a variety of spin moves around the basket.

That moment came at this statement,&amp;#8221;The schools justify their extra cost by offering accelerated programs and more robust distance-learning options that can accommodate a more demanding lifestyle. This, theyâve determined, is what the rest of higher education isnât offering â and itâs whatâs worth at least an extra $10,000.&amp;#8221; Please tell me the whole dollar amount of what the operational cost is to educate someone at the associate degree level; I&amp;#8217;ll give you a hint, the cost of tuition at community college isn&amp;#8217;t it. For-profits don&amp;#8217;t cost more because they think the services they provide are worth that much extra &amp;#8211; public institutions cost less because taxpayers subsidize a significant portion of the cost of education. State education budgets, federal education dollars; there is a river of taxpayer money propping up public institutions that the for profit sector is not eligible to receive. Bottom line, they cost more because students are picking up the entire cost of education rather than relying on taxpayers to pay for most of it.
