It&apos;s a worthy core vehicle that holds large-, medium- and small-capitalization companies. If you need growth in your portfolio and have retreated from stocks, it&apos;s still a good time to consider this index fund. The annual expenses are 0.05 percent annually, so it&apos;s a bargain. The fund has gained 21 percent for the year through September 20.

Young children do have early chronotypes (i.e. midsleep conducive to efficient learning), but given that recent research suggests adults need 6.5-7.5h of sleep (anything less - or more! - is harmful), I don&apos;t believe children aged 7 need that much more. Do said parents expect to wake children up at around 3-4 am, then?

A weaker recovery could force the central bank to extend the purchases, while stronger growth could accelerate the Fed&amp;rsquo;s timeline. The positive GDP report could encourage the Fed to pull back its support for the economy sooner, though no change in policy is expected to be announced Wednesday.

He was the first prominent Democrat in 1968 who opposed the war in Vietnam. You have a problem with that? Only when he showed it could be done, did Bobby Kennedy get into the race. I&apos;ve always been a great admirer of Eugene.
