Leading on 11-under, he and two others will come back early on Sunday to finish before the start of the final round.

He never has been a free agent, having signed extensions with the Nuggets and Knicks. &quot;Guys would like to have that situation and just see what it&apos;s about,&apos;&apos; he said. &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean that just because somebody wants to be that that they&apos;re going to leave. Me leaving would never came across in my mind.&apos;&apos;

I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of people putting food dye in their milk, which though I&amp;rsquo;m sure proves effective, seems slightly extreme. If you keep a careful track of everything you&amp;rsquo;ve bought and what&amp;rsquo;s yours in the fridge, combined with a couple of Sharpies and a wad of Post-It notes, it&amp;rsquo;ll be easier to stop things mysteriously disappearing.
