It added that an earlier pact publishers struck to settle the government&apos;s allegations against them has already rooted out the behavior that the court found to be anticompetitive, and can&apos;t recur again.

The amount of power used by households and firms is a good gauge of consumption and one that is hard to hide. One problem is that China subsidizes some prices so it&amp;#039;s somewhat mis-measured, but it&amp;#039;s a decent economic indicator. Credit Suisse estimates it&amp;#039;s around 9% annualised growth.

Nitrogen accumulation in large lakes can lead to nitrogen pollution downstream, in rivers and coastal areas. The findings suggest that human-caused acceleration of global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles have boosted nitrogen removal processes in small to medium-size lakes. But in many of Earth&amp;#8217;s large lakes, these effects are reduced by successful control of phosphorus, resulting in nitrogen accumulation.
