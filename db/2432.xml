    <body>What do you study? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/best-way-to-smuggle-drugs-into-jail-79a8.pdf#lovers&quot;&gt;top prescription drugs uk&lt;/a&gt;  We should not be content to merely laugh and roll our eyes the next time a politician makes a joke about how much we all hate Congress. We need to demand that our members of Congress work to make Congress better. We need Congress to actually function &amp;ndash; after all, a functioning Congress is what the Founders had in mind when they created it. Each time a member of Congress throws sand in the gears of the House or Senate, he exacerbates the public&apos;s low opinion of the national legislature and worsens a serious risk to the nation. These guys are smashing hammers into the walls instead of repairing the cracks. One day the roof could fall in.
