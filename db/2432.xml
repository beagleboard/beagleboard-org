Their offensive line has been allowing penetration. That will be more of an issue next week in Kansas City. Iâd expect the Giants to go with three wides all day and spread them out. Eli should be able to make better decisions. There have been a lot of factors in those interceptions, but I think heâs forcing things a little. Cam Newton seems to be playing tentatively. The Panthers are keeping him in the pocket and heâs not making plays with his legs. Thatâs in contrast to last yearâs game when Newton was running a lot of read-option.â
