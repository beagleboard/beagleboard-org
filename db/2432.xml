Howard still led the league in rebounding last season, but I think he&apos;s lost just enough of his trademark quickness/athleticism/leap that he can&apos;t quite cover for four terrible defensive teammates singlehandedly on every half-court possession night in and night out for 35-plus minutes a game like he did with Orlando. He doesn&apos;t want to get out there on the perimeter on those pick-and-rolls, and he&apos;s not nearly smart enough to make up for the lost athleticism as the Spurs series showed. The Rockets traded away Robinson and have no real power forwards to him either and by all indications are planning on playing small with four wretched defenders around him. I&apos;m sure Harden, Parsons and Lee are all thinking &quot;Sweet, we won&apos;t have to play any defense at all, we&apos;ve got Dwight to be the defense/rebound guy and he can just outlet to us for all these fast breaks!&quot; while Howard is thinking, &quot;Sweet, I&apos;m going to be the man here, get 30 post touches in the half-court a night and average 28 and 14 with all these three-point shooters around me and no ball-hogs like Kobe and none of that seven-seconds-or-less garbage.&quot;

For we were off to Italy, and as everyone knows, on the list of Italian stereotypical traits, somewhere between &amp;ldquo;militarily inept&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;flexible attitude to paying tax&amp;rdquo;, it is marked: &amp;ldquo;love babies&amp;rdquo;. And it&amp;rsquo;s true! They do.
