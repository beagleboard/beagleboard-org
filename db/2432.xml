    <body>Could I take your name and number, please? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?potassium.viagra.adalat.mega&quot;&gt;best drugs to cure premature ejaculation&lt;/a&gt;  3. About morals: I think people confuse moral values with religion too much (especially in the US). Children learn such things, not just from their parents or the Church but mainly from the social environment in which they grow up. A lot of students tell me that they know it&apos;s wrong to cheat but that&apos;s how you succeed (which means making a quick buck) nowadays and they are taught to &quot;optimise&quot; or &quot;maximise&quot; profits with the least amount of investment (intellectually or morally speaking). If you can &quot;rip off&quot; someone else in this cut-throat society and get a good grade without having to work hard, isn&apos;t that a WallStreet-smart move? Return on your investment or ROE. It&apos;s all about the &quot;metric&quot; man, not about &quot;morals&quot;. We should all change the way we teach kids starting in Kindergarten. NEVER SHARE!
