You see him flying around on the field. (But) for a young guy like that it&apos;s about staying in tune with the material because he&apos;s got all the physical gifts and he&apos;s got to stay healthy. The sky&apos;s the limit for him.&quot;

After he won two Super Bowls, the Giants will never announce they have fired Coughlin. He deserves much better. But I think itâs possible they will encourage him to retire at the end of the season if they feel the team has quit on him or that a two-year rebuilding project requires a younger coach.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/paylessupplementsconz-2397.pdf&quot;&gt;xanaxaddictions.com&lt;/a&gt;  A cursory look at the Redsâ on-paper talent might lead one to conclude they underachieved this year, but Bakerâs defenders point out that he went the whole season without his projected cleanup hitter, Ryan Ludwick (shoulder surgery), and most of the year without his No. 1 starter, Johnny Cueto (strained right lat), while in losing their final five games of the season, their middle-of-the-order hitters, Joey Votto, Brandon Phillips and Jay Bruce, were all essentially marked absent. Phillips went so far as to say he flat-out choked. So with Baker gone, leaving baseball with only two minority managers, Ron Washington in Texas and Bo Porter in Houston, the question is: Who does Jocketty pick to succeed him? There have been a lot of rumblings that Jocketty is said to favor the much-traveled (and fired) Jim Riggleman, which prompts the question: What do all these GMs see in this guy whoâs been a loser every place heâs ever managed and walked out in a snit fit on his last team, the Washington Nationals, when they were in first place in 2011, because his boss, GM Mike Rizzo, wouldnât commit to giving him an extension? Meanwhile, Larkin has expressed to intimates heâd very much like to manage, and even though heâs never done it before, his leadership ability is unquestioned and he would certainly command respect. He would also resolve the minority issue. Reds owner Bob Castellini is a fan of ânameâ managers â it was he who overruled previous Reds GM Wayne Krivsky (who wanted to retain interim Pete Mackanin) to hire Baker back in 2007 â and there is no bigger name in Cincinnati than Larkin. It would thus seem if Larkin says he wants it, Riggleman would be a hard sell for Jocketty with the owner.
