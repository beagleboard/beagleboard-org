As, it seems, is his marriage to Kaitlin&amp;rsquo;s mother: a letter from a close friend suggests she may be seeking comfort in the arms of a work colleague. Both parents, meanwhile, are struggling to rebuild their fractured relationship with younger daughter Sam, who it turns out is the real protagonist of the tale. Her story is affectingly relayed through journal entries we hear Sam read out to her older sister as certain items are found.
