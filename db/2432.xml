That will take some time and energy and opportunity to realize the unique synergies that we bring to the table vis-Ã -vis that transaction. But at the same time, as we&apos;ve said, we have a lot of flexibility in our balance sheet to do some other things, so we&apos;ll also focus on other opportunities. Gannett is committed to increasing shareholder value in the medium to long term. We always, at the board level, are looking every time we meet and in between meetings, we are looking at opportunities to increase shareholder value. We never rule anything out, but our focus right now is a transaction that has created a lot of value for the company and will create even more into the future. So we&apos;re focused on that in the short term, to have a successful integration.
