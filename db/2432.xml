    <body>How do I get an outside line? &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?viagra.tadalafil.mellaril.adapalene&quot;&gt;ziprint image corporation&lt;/a&gt;  The number of market-rate rental apartments available to those of low income is extremely small. A metaphor one often hears about the homeless is that of the musical chairs: with such a small number of low-income-affordable apartments, the players who are less able to compete, for whatever reason, don&amp;#8217;t get the chairs when the music stops. Every year, more and more chairs are taken away. The existence of so many people who are homeless indicates that a very large number of renters are close to that condition. Housing advocates in the Bronx report that some of the people they try to help are paying seventy per cent of their income in rent and that others are living doubled up and tripled up and in unimproved basements and in furnace rooms&amp;#8212;conditions that recall the days of Jacob Riis.
