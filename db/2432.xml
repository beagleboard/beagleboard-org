I huffed, puffed, fell over a few times and was absolutely exhausted by the end of the session. Moreover, the infuriating serenity of Horton and his fellow trainers &amp;ndash; in stark contrast to my grunts of exertion and clumsy stumbling &amp;ndash; was anger-inducing and frustrating.

It was the kind that becomes an instant classic, similar to Hanksâ âCastaway.â I feel cheesy saying it, but it was one of those that will make you laugh, make you cry and have you on the edge of your seat.

Each one had a distinct personality, and it really gave the film some heart. Even though they were the bad guys, I couldnât help feeling sorry for them. Good and evil was not a clear-cut relationship in the film, and the piratesâ characterization rounded out the plot.
