    <body>I&apos;d like to cancel a cheque &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/stmap_bac90.html?cialis.tenormin.aripiprazole.azithromycin&quot;&gt;vinkempharma.com&lt;/a&gt;  To a great extent, this is an intergenerational transfer. Now we didn&amp;#8217;t need David Willets to tell us that we baby-boomers have never had it so good and our good fortune is to some extent at the expense of the young, who have to pay for our index-linked state pensions and all the benefits in kind we enjoy. But it is also because my generation was brought up to believe that security came from saving, whereas the young are far more inclined to borrow â hence Britain&amp;#8217;s disastrously-low saving rate, far below that of almost any of our competitors. Throughout the post-war period Britons have seen their savings expropriated by the authorities by a combination of raids on pension funds, more taxation and high inflation. Unsurprisingly, they have responded by over-investing in housing, the only asset available to ordinary folk that seemed to be sheltered from the vagaries of economics and the greed of politicians ââ which brings me to the second area where QE is doing a lot of damage.
