    <body>A financial advisor &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/all-night-lover-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;all night lover sylvia lett&lt;/a&gt;  Separate studies from Britain and the United States that were published in the British Medical journal have associated a relationship between the exposures to high levels of aircraft noise near busy international airports and a higher risk of heart disease and strokes. These findings make complete sense to me and I am glad that research has been done to validate this correlation and to spread awareness of this health issue. The environment we live in can have a great effect on our mood and health, therefore it is imperative that we take these findings and make certain changes. We may not be able to relocate existent airports, however we can construct new airports in environments that are not so populated. Furthermore, this information may effect where people decide to live. Someone who is looking for a new location to reside to can now decide whether they want to live in an area that has been proven to engender an increased risk of heart disease and other cardiac illnesses. Expansion of airports and the construction of new airports in highly populated areas need to take these results into consideration in the future.
