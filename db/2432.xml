Gen. Sutarman told reporters the explosion happened Sunday night at the Ekayana Grha Buddhist temple in West Jakarta. The bombs were apparently placed outside the building, and the blast caused minimal damage. Police were investigating and continuing to sweep the area.

In the past, ELA covered a wide swath of content but was often very shallow. Thatâs why many of our graduates require remediation when they get to college. Now, the focus is on teaching our students to read and write about fiction and nonfiction so that they deeply understand the texts, and communicate that understanding.

Her path to motherhood was through her art, filmmaking, and so we see her figure out her desire to become a single parent (courtesy of a sperm-donor friend) and suss out her relationships to her friendsâ children, her niece and her own dad and late mom. When her son is born, small moments take on big meaning . Though Davenportâs film sometimes defines itself, uncomfortably but proudly, as video diary, the filmâs heart is hard to resist.
