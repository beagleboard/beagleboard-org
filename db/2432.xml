Yael Kozar made the difficult decision to put her television career on hold for her child. &quot;I couldn&apos;t trust the world,&quot; she said.

I&amp;#8217;d now guess that the finale is building toward what it&amp;#8217;s looked like: some revenge plot against Jack and company, abetted by Jesse (who now has a reason powerful enough to ally even with Walt), then freeing up Walt and Jesse for some final, cathartic confrontation. (Though what do I know? Is Walt carrying a machine gun for Gretchen and Elliott too?) He offered his son his money and was rejected. He has nothing to give anyone anymore but his freedom, or his life.

The whole point of going to a &quot;front page&quot; whether in print or online or at the top of the hour on your favorite broadcast is to find out the most important news stories. There are editors and reporters whose whole job is to scour stories, interview economists, dodge bullets, chase reluctant politicians, and, yes, even harangue starlets and then come back and tell us what, as best as they can determine, is going on in the world. One day, studies about fracking may be top of the news, the next, fraudulent Wall Street schemes.
