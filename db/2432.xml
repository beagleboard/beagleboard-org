The Sudanese and South Sudanese governments reached a mutual agreement two months ago which allowed more than 700 South Sudanese oil wells to begin pumping again more than a year after they were shut down over an oil revenue sharing dispute between the two governments.

It&amp;rsquo;s not just that author and subject are shades by the time the book reaches us; and not even that you can&amp;rsquo;t tell if Evans is really writing it as if on Gardner&amp;rsquo;s behalf.
