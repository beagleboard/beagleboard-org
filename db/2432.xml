The first time I visited Australia was in 1982 with the Comic Strip comedy team &amp;ndash; Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Peter Richardson, Nigel Planer, Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall &amp;ndash; to appear at the Adelaide Festival. When we landed in South Australia, everybody else was dumbstruck by the azure blue seas, the parrots in the trees and the red earth, but what stunned me most were the cars. Parked on the street or cruising the highways, I goggled at the sight of vehicles that seemed to closely resemble the native flora and fauna in that their gaudiness and oddness could not possibly exist anywhere else. For me it all added to the sense of dislocation I felt in this strange, exotic and sometimes very dark and cruel country.

Among them were two Chicago friends, Marty Nesbitt and Eric Whitaker, the latter of which attended grad school with Obama at Harvard. So were high school friends Mike Ramos and Bobby Titcomb, who was arrested in 2011 in Honolulu on suspicion of soliciting a prostitute. The Associated Press reported that he pleaded &amp;#8220;no contest&amp;#8221; later that year; Obama has played golf with him at least twice since the arrest.
