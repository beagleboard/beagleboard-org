When we have been referring to fine jewelry, we are primarily talking about platinum and gold jewelry with the diamonds and/or other gemstones. Statement refers to jewelry pieces typically retailing for more than $50,000. And fashion jewelry is predominantly about non-gemstone jewelry and silver, gold and the RUBEDO metal, although small gemstones might be used as accents in some pieces. Now having provided those definitions, merchandising highlights in the quarter continued to reflect sales growth in fine and statement jewelry that outperformed the modest growth in fashion jewelry sales. Our success in higher-price-point jewelry does revolve around diamonds, including strong response to our growing assortment of colored diamonds. This range is from the statement jewelry category that had continued sell-through from April&apos;s Blue Book event and sales from our very successful Gatsby collection to solitaire diamond engagement rings, including the distinctive new Harmony collection, to the extraordinary Yellow Diamond jewelry collection, the Enchant diamond jewelry collection, our select collections with diamonds and colored stones, Tiffany Keys in diamonds and in gold and Tiffany&apos;s Metro collection. But as we&apos;ve been saying recently, we&apos;re also focused on improving the fashion jewelry category, but in a luxury-brand-appropriate way. New designs, such as the Ziegfeld collection in silver, freshwater pearls and onyx that was introduced in the second quarter to strong customer response, and the reinterpretation of our iconic Atlas collection that makes its official debut on September 10, along with others in the product development pipeline, are intended to generate improving fashion jewelry sales trends over the next year.
