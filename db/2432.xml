    <body>Which year are you in? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?betamethasone.escitalopram.bicalutamide.levitra&quot;&gt;comprar kamagra oral jelly barata&lt;/a&gt;  Nicklaus named the course in honor of the Scottish layout where he won his first Open Championship (in 1966), but it&amp;rsquo;s evident throughout, especially on this par-3, that he was actually more inspired by the strategy and land plan of Augusta National. This downhill par 3 sets up as a version of the famed short 12th hole where they play the Masters, except there&amp;rsquo;s more going on vertically here because of the more intense topography. That said, the green is angled the same way, and the genius of the hole is that if you hit it perfectly equal to mid-green and pull it, you&amp;rsquo;re long left and in sand; and if you hit it equal to dead center but push it, you&amp;rsquo;re in water. The trick here is judging the wind, no easy matter when the tee shot plays out of a tree-lined chute to a massive amphitheater, where evidence of the wind above the tree line might not manifest itself in any movement on the ground. Restraint here is a virtue, especially when the hole is cut back right near the edge of doom. And risky play here can exact severe punishment. A player on Sunday coming in three-down who wants to play aggressively (i.e., desperately) is more likely to walk away four down rather than two.
