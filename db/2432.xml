    <body>I&apos;m only getting an answering machine &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?cialis.almond-cucumber.nolvadex&quot;&gt;tnmedicalselection.org&lt;/a&gt;  But no one wants Jeter to leave on terms other than his own, no one wants to see him walk out the door until he is ready, knowing that when he does quit the Yankees for good, it will be like a hundred guys left the room. But these were fair questions for him on this day when this season ended for him, just when the games are getting good, when it is his time of year.
