The cancer begins in the bone marrow, where oxygen-carrying red blood cells and infection-fighting white blood cells are born. Acute lymphocytic leukemia, the most common childhood leukemia, develops when healthy white blood cells, or lymphocytes, multiply wildly and crowd out normal cells. Brain cancer, on the other hand, occurs when cancerous cells begin massing into a tumor that invades healthy brain tissue. This can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, or a change in vision, hearing, memory or balance. A relatively rare cancer overall, the rate of brain cancer has remained steady since the mid-&apos;80s when MRIs were introduced and used to diagnose the disease. Brain tumors are more common among adults, yet they still are found in about 4,100 kids each year in the U.S.

He is not an elite shutdown corner yet, though, as much as he talks of being one. Former defensive coordinator Dick Jauron usually assigned the opponent&apos;s top receiver to Haden. Horton hasn&apos;t said whether he will do that, and whether he does could be determined by whom he chooses to play right cornerback. The position is unsettled; McFadden is a rookie, Skrine has speed but is undisciplined - nine penalties last year - and Owens failed to establish himself as a solid starter in four years in Atlanta. Gipson is in his first year starting, but is big and strong and an upgrade over Usama Young. Offensive coordinators that enjoyed isolating faster receivers on Young won&apos;t have the same success with Gipson. Bademosi adds punch to a secondary that lacks strong hitters after Ward. The Browns allowed 27 touchdown passes last year yet waited until the third round to draft a cornerback (McFadden). The hope is an improved pass rush will make life in the secondary easier.

Yes I realize the mechanics of the back#$@ward situation we&amp;#8217;ve created (or should I say the FED has created).
