    <body>The manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/stop-emotional-eating-book-7ef0.pdf&quot;&gt;self hypnosis to stop emotional eating&lt;/a&gt;  In Florida, his companies have exploited lax state oversight while leaning on powerful allies inside the government to keep the contracts flowing. Slattery, his wife, Diane, and other executives have been prodigious political rainmakers in Florida, donating more than $400,000 to state candidates and committees over the last 15 years, according to HuffPost&amp;#8217;s review. The recipient of the largest share of those dollars was the Florida Republican Party, which took in more than $276,000 in that time. Former Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, an avid supporter of prison privatization, received more than $15,000 from company executives during state and federal races.
