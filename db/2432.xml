    <body>Sorry, I ran out of credit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcmpovos.com/hormon-prostaglandin-adalah-62bd.pdf#belfry&quot;&gt;prostaglandin effects&lt;/a&gt;  Self-regulation does exist to prevent alcohol manufacturers advertising in a way that might seem attractive to children, but this is not fit for purpose, said the researchers. &quot;[Regulation] seems to me to focus on saying what sort of stories we can have in adverts but it does nothing to combat or reduce the constant bombardment that we&apos;re seeing of just very simple branding throughout the matches, that we know is harmful to our children,&quot; said Adams. The current regulation focuses on alcohol advertising and not on the embedded marketing they have identified, she added.
