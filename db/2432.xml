She might have rolled her eyes and made a comment back. And it&apos;s because Thomas was a professional reporter in the most critical meaning of the phrase. She reported. She asked direct questions without caring if they offended the subject of her inquiry, but she didn&apos;t ask questions whose sole purpose was to embarrass the subject of her inquiry. She was a newswoman, pure and simple. And we are all the worse for losing her.
