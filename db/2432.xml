    <body>Remove card &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?virility-pills.pfiagara.levitra&quot;&gt;top 10 drugstore buys&lt;/a&gt;  Sadly, were &quot;they&quot; to be successful then there would be another civil war just like the ones ongoing in the Middle East today (and centuries old in many cases) between the various religious factions to see whose version of god and &quot;gods word&quot; would be the basis for that theocracy. Mormons would claim the right to be the basis for the theocracy because their prophet is at least a good old home grown American (the whole buy America thing might give them bonus points). Catholics believe theirs should be numero uno since they believe they are the only true religion to start with. Hard to say about the Protestants since there would be so much in fighting just between the sects within that one larger group. Jews would say it should be their religious beliefs but that might be harder sell since even in Israel they haven`t won that battle. Muslims might join in.....they are growing in numbers after all world-wide. And that is only the Abrahamic religions..... what about all the other ones. All would have a piece of the civil war pie.
