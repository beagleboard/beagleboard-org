    <body>Will I get paid for overtime? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/can-ibuprofen-cause-bleeding-in-early-pregnancy-e0f9.pdf&quot;&gt;is it bad if i took ibuprofen before i knew i was pregnant&lt;/a&gt;  I believe this article smacks of anti-russia pro usa bias. Some of the points are not based on relevant facts but biased arguments. Putin has gained a legitimate international standing when it comes to syria. The quotes of &amp;#8220;few countries want assad&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;considered a rouge dictatorship by every advanced democracy&amp;#8221; are laughable. WESTERN countries do not want assad now, less than five years ago Hillary Clinton was conducting State Department visits to Syria, shaking hands and making deals. What changed? They could not CONTROL assad anymore. I believe that leaving Assad in place is infinitely preferable to the U.S led chaos that continues in Lybia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia is doing the U.S a favor by intervening and stopping conflict. Sochi will be a win for Putin despite the political overtones, lest we forget CHINA was host to the olympics, were there protests there? NO
