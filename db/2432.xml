Israel announces the construction of 2,000 settler homes in east Jerusalem and the West Bank and the freezing of funds due to the Palestinian Authority.

Many of the requirements are costly and cosmetic, requiring clinics &amp;ndash; without financial assistance from the state &amp;ndash; to widen hallways, doorways and even entrance awnings.&quot; So not being able to get a gurney to a woman in trouble is a &quot;cosmetic&quot; problem, not a safety concern? Women&apos;s health advocates told the Post that as a result, all but one clinic in North Carolina &quot;would probably close&quot; because of associated costs, all but five clinics in Texas &quot;would probably&quot; close, and at least one clinic in Ohio is &quot;already feeling the pinch.&quot; Similar predictions followed the restrictions on Pennsylvania clinics after the Kermit Gosnell verdict; yet news reports show that only five had actually closed, most voluntarily.
