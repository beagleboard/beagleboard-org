    <body>What qualifications have you got? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/sinequan-drugscom-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;sinequan drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  After being found in a remote mountain cabin, Uruguayan Raul Gomez is comforted by relatives at a hospital in San Juan, Argentina, Sunday, Sept. 8, 2013. The 58-year-old man who spent four months lost while trying to walk across the Andean mountains is recovering in an Argentine hospital. It wasn&apos;t clear at first what led Gomez with apparently no mountaineering experience to make the trek from Chile. Now it turns out that Gomez was fleeing from the law. Chilean authorities say child sex abuse charges were filed against him in April. (AP Photo/Telam)
