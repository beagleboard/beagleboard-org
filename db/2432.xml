    <body>I came here to work &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlam.com/index.php/stmap_77410.html?mask.cialis.sustiva&quot;&gt;bhv pharmaceutical&lt;/a&gt;  You&amp;#8217;ll find that Organophosphates are classified as nerve agents, and there are no way any &amp;#8220;herbal teas&amp;#8221; can have any effect on it as not only will the absorption of any liquid be too slow, it would also be completely useless against the toxin that targets the nerves in the body unless you mix in extracts from highly poisonous plants like Belladonna, in which case, your tea would cause more harm than good. You&amp;#8217;ll see that they are classified in the same category as nerve gases like Sarin and VX, which are some of the worst chemical warfare agents ever produced. The real antidote is Atropine (made from the extract of the belladonna plant, also called Deadly Nightshade) which usually is injected directly into the muscles affected (including the heart, to prevent the nerve agent from causing a cardiac arrest). You&amp;#8217;ll find that in your example, Paraquat Dichloride (research the actual name of the herbicide next time), death usually comes about a month after ingestion (from gradual organ failure), while Organophosphates only takes minutes to kill someone (by causing cardiac arrest) if a lethal dose is ingested.
