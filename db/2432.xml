This is one of the options you can choose immediately you extract &amp;ndash; with some difficulty &amp;ndash; the stylus from the back of the device. It allows users to, say, write an email address and then get the device to recognise it and pop it straight into the &amp;lsquo;To&amp;rsquo; field of an email; write a phone number and it will take you straight to the dialler; write a postcode and it can take you straight to a map. These are genuine time-saving features that make the most of accurate handwriting recognition and instant access to the internet, although why notes and memos are different is a moot point. By and large, though, the menu that appears as soon as you extract the &apos;S Pen&apos; stylus makes the Note easier to use than its predecessor.

It&amp;#39;s one of those brands that we associate with going shopping with our Mum to John Lewis or House of Fraser where it was always next to MaxMara and Country Casuals. But Gerard Darel is a lot more than just a department store stalwart. In fact in recent weeks a number of celebrities have been seen carrying the new covetable Gerard Darel fold over shoulder bag and Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Garner have been seen in the same maxi dress by Darel. So look again with fresh eyes at this high street hero and you never know what you&amp;#39;ll find.
