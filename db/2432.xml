It&apos;s about confidence... people are frightened of moving job and companies are of hiring. It&apos;s wait and see.&quot;

A ship is spotted at dawn sailing just over the horizon, and it is viewed and reported to command immediately. The men are then told by Dusty to clean and check their F88 Austeyr rifles for a patrol around the island. Within just minutes of setting out from camp, we come across tracks of an estimated 3-meter-long crocodile. I ask myself if I am glad we found this out this morning, or would it have been better before we went to sleep? But it&amp;#8217;s best not to ask such questions. Either way, itâs an ominous sign of just how dangerous this area is. The patrol makes its way through thick bush land, along a dried-up creek bed, up a ridge, down the other side, up another ridge, across a swamp, and finally, down another hill and into camp. And during all this, we are constantly pestered by nasty green ants that hang from low-lying branches and make their way into your shirt, hat and worst of all, your pants. However, Lance-corporal Danny Daniels shows me my first âbush tuckerâ trick, and what he calls ârevengeâ. If you grab an ant by its head, you put the rest of its body into your mouth, and bite. Not exactly a substantial meal, but a sweet and nutritious one that can be useful when walking for hours. Once sitting back at camp, the soldiers tell Dusty that they spotted a âspear treeâ not far from camp. He is more than happy that the guys might be able to catch a fish for lunch, and so we head out to retrieve it. Without even a slight deviation, we come across it within minutes. They chop down the thin, 7-foot-high tree, and carry it back to camp. But on the way, we stop at some mangroves to dig for mud clams, and then we stop at some rocks along the beach for some fresh oysters â just another day in the bush with the locals. The spear tree is shaved of its bark, and slowly roasted over the fire to remove what remains. At one end, a small notch is made to tie a sharp metal spike that the soldiers obviously carry with them for such an occasion, and within just 30 minutes, a perfectly straight and smooth throwing spear is ready for hunting. Meanwhile, the clams are roasting on the fire, and the most amazing and perfect thing about them is that when they are ready, they magically open, and can be easily removed from their shell. And let me tell you, they were better than any mussel or scallop I have ever eaten.
