Unlike Malickâs âBadlandsâ â or a Robert Duvall-starrer called âTomorrowâ â once Bob comes back, and the story starts to pivot on the tension with the deputy, the movie meanders. Nonetheless, Mara is angular and agonized, miles away from her punk hacker in âThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.â Affleck, whose odd affect and manner are often underappreciated, is spooky, driven and unpredictable. They make up for the filmâs lack of purpose and ambling soul.

The fact is that Michael was a drug addict for years. Who&amp;#8217;s fault was that? Humm, lets see, Maybe your it was Joe&amp;#8217;s fault! Nah, couldn&amp;#8217;t be him because you can&amp;#8217;t sue Joe. Maybe it was his siblings fault! Nah, they are as screwed up as Michael was. Maybe it was dare I say it? Your fault! Nah, your his innocent mother that has always stayed in the background and your husband beat the crap out of your children. Okay so we have pretty much ruled out your entire messed up family. Wait a minute, I think I have figured it out. How about Michael? Yes, that&amp;#8217;s it. He was the idiot that overdosed himself. He asked for the drugs.
