Finally tasted victory in the league â at a record 25th attempt â when Redknapp brought him on as a sub with Spurs four up at home to Burnley. Still seen as back-up to Assou-Ekotto until an injury to the Cameroonian in January. He impressed in a 4-0 FA Cup win over Peterborough and enjoyed a storming end to the campaign as Spurs finished fourth to reach the Champions League play-offs. Bale also rediscovered his scoring boots in the final month of the campaign, overcoming FA Cup semi-final heartbreak against Portsmouth to score in wins over Arsenal and Chelsea in the following week, as well at Burnley on the final day. Signed another four-year deal.
