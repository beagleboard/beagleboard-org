    <body>Pleased to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/celogen-pharma-pvt-ltd-mahape-2206.pdf#deception&quot;&gt;celogen pharma p.ltd&lt;/a&gt;  The assertion that Al Qaeda -- with the death of Usama bin Laden and of many of his lieutenants -- is a shell of its former self was a linchpin of the 2012 Obama campaign. Even with the ongoing security threat, the State Department insisted as recently as Tuesday that the &quot;Al Qaeda core has been weakened, decimated,&quot; despite lingering concerns about the affiliates. President Obama repeated, during a visit Wednesday to Camp Pendleton, that &quot;the core of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the way to defeat.&quot;

Where else can you sell and actually accept payment for something you donât make, are not required to show or display, canât deliver, which does not exist? The âCap &amp; Trade schemeâ and the âEmperorâs New Clothesâ story have a lot in common, those being a hustlerâs con and scam, and a gullible public so intimidated by political correctness that they irrationally convince themselves that their own eyes/minds are lying to them.
