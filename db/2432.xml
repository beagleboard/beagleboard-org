Fowey Rocks coastal marine buoy recorded sustained winds of 141 mph with a peak gust of 169 mph and the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables had sustained winds of 115 mph with a peak gust of 164 mph. A storm surge of 16.9 feet occurred in Biscayne Bay. Homestead Air Force Base was practically wiped out. The WSR-57 radar dome at the Miami National Weather Service Office was destroyed. More than 125,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving 250,000 people homeless. 41 people were killed and the damage estimate exceeded 25 billion dollars, making Andrew by far the most costly hurricane in history. Andrew was the third most intense hurricane on record to strike the U.S. behind Hurricane Camille (1969) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1935).
