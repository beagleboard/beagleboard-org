    <body>Punk not dead  &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?dramamine.lithium.levitra.stavudine&quot;&gt;www.apteka.com.au&lt;/a&gt;  We are all aware of the really excellent work that you are doing and but there are a number of specific areas that the prime minister thinks need further immediate action. You are likely to receive a further message from colleagues in DCMS and the Home Office regarding tackling illegal images but given the short deadline for this work we thought it better to give you some time to work on these issues in the meantime. I need to report back to No 10 by the end of the week on these points so I would be grateful if you could consider this request as a matter of urgency and respond by midday Friday.
