It is already stimulating much needed increased construction of new homes and around 90% of sales on the scheme have been to first-time buyers.

Now, the Studios automatically power on if they&apos;re plugged into a source, and they power off once unplugged. You still need to have the Studios &quot;on&quot; to listen to music, but between the 20-hour battery and the newfound simplicity, your Studios should always be available for listening.
