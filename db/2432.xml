Bradley had eight birdies en route to a 8-under par 63 after marching back onto the course for his second round in The Barclays in Jersey City. It would leave him tied for fourth with Rickie Fowler (64) and Adam Scott (66), three shots out of Matt Kucharâs lead at 10-under, with Kuchar still having five holes to complete Saturday morning.
