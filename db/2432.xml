The rally on the Dow, which not long ago had crossed 15,000, pulled back sharply. Treasury rates jumped to a 20-month high by late June. (When yields go up, bond prices go down.)

In recent years, under the first wave ofÂ modernization, ChinaâsÂ progressÂ to middle-income status has been astounding and dramatic. In the first decade of theÂ century, ChinaÂ became the worldâs largest manufacturer. In 2009, China surpassed Germany as the world&amp;#8217;s largestÂ exporter. In 2010 it passed the U.S. toÂ become the world&amp;#8217;s largest car producer. But already, even before this next stage ofÂ modernization &amp;#8212; diversification &amp;#8212; is underway,Â China is gradually reducing its role as a processor of lower-value-added technological goods. As a share of national income, services have just overtaken manufacturing, and since 2011 consumer spending has been a bigger driver of growth than investment. In the future, China will depend less on exports to the West. In the last 10 years, merchandise exports to developing economies have already doubled, to 25 percent. And China is now sending capital around the world. ItsÂ portfolioÂ of $110 billion in loans since 2000 rivals that of the World Bank.

The new figures came yesterday as the Scottish Government launched its winter readiness campaign.
