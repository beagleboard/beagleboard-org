It works with a remote control and, unlike most TV and cable boxes, the interface is drop dead simple. The other issue is content. Right now, Chromecast only has apps for YouTube and Netflix while Roku and Apple TV have many more viewing options.  Of course, Google will reach out to developers and expand the offerings and there is a way to play other video through a PC but thatâs still a bit too complex a solution for watching TV.  Even tech savvy people sometimes want to kick back and watch TV without having to fuss with their phones, PCs or tablets.

The bosses believe they know what their customers want. Their vast investments in plant and equipment insulate them from the disruptive impact of a changing marketplace.
