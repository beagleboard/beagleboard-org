Professor Hasib Ahmed, clinical director for women&apos;s services, said: &quot;Thousands of mothers choose to give birth at Medway Maritime hospital and our specialist staff safely deliver over 5,000 babies every year â¦ We are making positive progress with our midwifery recruitment, appraisal and mandatory training. We are also reminding staff of our local governance processes and systems which ensure that we continuously improve and enhance our maternity services to build on the excellent patient feedback we receive.&quot;
