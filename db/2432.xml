Sosa is being charged with lying on his American citizenship application about his alleged role in the Guatemalan military and involvement in a 1982 massacre during Guatemala&amp;#x2019;s civil war. His trial is scheduled to start Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2013, in federal court in Riverside, Calif. Sosa claims he was not in the village during the killings.
