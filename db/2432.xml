    <body>A law firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/viagra-uk-free-delivery-e3c4.pdf#scholar&quot;&gt;women viagra pills uk&lt;/a&gt;  He noted that a huge chunk of the increase came from California, saying that the Golden State&apos;s &quot;data has been really quirky lately because something&apos;s going on with their computer system over there so we don&apos;t know exactly how to interpret that. But regardless of how you interpret California it&apos;s still a very, very large increase in claims.&quot; And he also noted that the increase does not reflect new claims by federal workers who have been furloughed, as they are reported separately. (Around 15,000 of the claims did come from private sector workers who rely on federal spending for their jobs.)
