After attending the Met Gala together on May 6, 2013, the couple headed to the star-studded after-party at the Boom Boom Room on top of the Standard Hotel, where Woods had too much to drink, according to Us Weekly. Woods reportedly danced awkwardly and publicly grabbed Vonn&apos;s butt. By 2 a.m., when the couple started to exit the party, Woods apparently fell while attempting to walk up a small flight of steps. According to a witness, his tumble caused him to freeze until a stern-faced Vonn came to his rescue, helping him to his feet and guiding him on their way out.
