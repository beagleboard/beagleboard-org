    <body>Could I take your name and number, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/acne-medication-accutane-side-effects-213a.pdf&quot;&gt;can you drink whilst on accutane&lt;/a&gt;  As I leave, Chloe and Amy are sitting at the kitchen table, playing with their phones and flicking through a copy of Hello!.
