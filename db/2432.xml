She said that she wanted to wage a war against illiteracy and terrorism, but had no use for the tools of violence. âLet us pick up our books and our pens,â Yousafzai urged. âThey are our most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world.â The audience, both inside the U.N. hall where she spoke and among the many who saw the speech live on television around the world, responded with tearful applause. Former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown hailed Yousafzai as âthe most courageous girl in the world.â
