In recent years, however, an extremist fringe has grown louder.

One of the main foreign policy goals of his first term - the &quot;reset&quot; in relations with Moscow - has now unwound.

Landmark cases come from Meredith Chivers, an assistant professor of psychology at Queen&apos;s University in Kingston, Ontario, who found that women&apos;s perceptions of arousal did not match their actual arousal. Using sensors to measure genital blood flow while watching porn, she found that women who claimed to be turned on only by heterosexual images were, in fact, aroused by straight sex, lesbian sex, gay sex and even, to a lesser degree, sex between bonobo monkeys. (Gay and straight men, incidentally, accurately reported their sense of arousal, and the bonobo monkeys did nothing for them.) Another of Chivers&apos; studies found that women became most aroused by stories about sex with strangers, even though they claimed to feel more enticed by the idea of sex with longtime lovers.

Its authors, the members of the commission, should be seen as national heroes. The level of detail, the intricate analysis, the bold and fearless judgements and the searing truthfulness of the assessments in the report merit more than one reading of the report. It is a great report.
