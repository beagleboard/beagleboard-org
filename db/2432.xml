He made his way back to Tulsa, and was considering giving up on a career in music when his friend Leon Russell (whose song Delta Lady was famously recorded by Joe Cocker in 1969) persuaded him to join him in Los Angeles, where Russell was a leading session musician. Cale was quickly offered session work, and in 1967 made his first album, A Trip Down the Sunset Strip, with a band called The Leathercoated Minds; Cale wrote several of the songs, co-produced the record with Snuff Garrett, and took the opportunity to show off his skills as a guitarist.
