Just when I thought I&apos;d left your kind behind forever, you come back with a vengeance. At 18 years-old I would have railed against this like it was the root of all evil. Thankfully I grew up and got - or at least occasionally manage to simulate - a sense of humour. Thanks once again, lovely internet.
