Stern is stepping down in February to be succeeded by Adam Silver after an administration of 30 years. The commissioner spearheaded the leagueâs expansion beyond the traditional US market and his vision of globalization has opened the doors to unprecedented growth. Stern has often cited the Philippines as the country with the biggest NBA following on Facebook and Twitter outside the US and described it as a major NBA market. When he retires, the NBA will have played 148 games outside the US, including 18 regular season encounters.
