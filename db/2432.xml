    <body>Where do you come from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/promethazine-dm-syrup-yellow-get-high-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;phenergan with codeine drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  If conspiring against the very country whose govt you have been part of isn&amp;#039;t treason then I don&amp;#039;t what is. altaf hussain has a lot of explaining to do. He has been caught in so many lies thats its not even funny any more. ISI should kidnap him and bring him back to Pakistan and add his name to the missing person&amp;#039;s list. By the time kana judges takes notice, altaf will have lost so much weight that nobody would recognize him. His punishment should be to make him live in Karachi and not let him have any security. Lets see how many weeks, days, hours or minutes he lasts. And publish his adress in the newspapers. By the way, Jehan Ara is correct in her obveservations :)

The week that Netflix announced that they were coming to Canada, Rogers scrapped the unlimited plan and gave me an awesome 80Gb cap, citing that they were protecting us poor consumers from bandwidth throttling (which they do anyways). It has absolutely nothing to do with how &amp;#8220;thinly&amp;#8221; populated Canada is, and has everything to do with the fact that our Government has allowed Rogers, Bell and Telus to carve out a monopoly in our country, and this includes Cable, Internet and mobile service. Google the total cost to the consumer for an iphone 4, in Canada a three year plan costs the consumer $3,300, compared to $1,000 in the US.
