There is reputational risk if a broker fails to garner enough investor interest to get a retail bond off the ground. On the other hand, brokers who want to maintain their reputations should only back a retail bond if the company raising money is reliable.

The only other person running in the election is Wajihuddin Ahmed, a retired Sindh High Court judge nominated by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, led by former cricket star Imran Khan.

For the new study, the scientists injected the brains of mice with beta-amyloid, a substance that builds up in Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and followed its movement. They determined that it was removed faster from the brains of sleeping mice than awake mice.

Davies is this generation&amp;rsquo;s chance to do better. It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating that they won&amp;rsquo;t report until after the next election &amp;ndash; time really is of the essence. Be that as it may, we should be under no illusions: this really is our last chance. If we fail to take it, Britain will never again fulfill its economic potential. The Government is prepared to sink massive political capital into the publicly-funded HS2 rail link. We need the same courage in relation to privately-financed air links. It is already clear that if we in Britain don&amp;rsquo;t act, others will. As hub capacity transfers to Paris or Dubai the direct routes to vital new markets will follow. By failing over the last 30 years to ensure that our hub airport kept pace with the growth in demand for air travel, we not only squandered our dominant aviation status and the resulting commercial advantages, we also left the field open to other European cities to step into our shoes.
