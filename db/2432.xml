Earlier gene therapy trials using different viruses had a flaw: When the viruses plunked themselves into the patientâs DNA, they sometimes amped up activity of neighboring cancer-causing genes, leading to leukemia. That side effect, along with the death of a young man participating in another clinical trial, nearly halted gene therapy in the United States in the early 2000s.
