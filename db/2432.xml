At the time he took office, he feared that New Yorkers had come to accept homelessness as a condition of city life, and the possibility alarmed him. He said, &amp;#8220;We are too strong, and too smart, and too compassionate a city to surrender to the scourge of homelessness. We won&amp;#8217;t do it.

When Americans see all of the bombings and shootings in the region, they are reluctant to send their children until they see the children of the president, cabinet, NSC, intelligence agencies, Senate, and House dodging bombs and bullets. Add to that the corporate crimes that lax US regulation allowed, and most Americans would cheer islamic insurgents as they blow up and shoot the rugrats of the slimy, disgusting, corrupt US leaders who allowed Wall Street bankers to cheat everyone else.
