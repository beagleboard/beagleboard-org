Haleigh was last seen at home in the early-morning hours of Feb. 10, 2009. She was reported missing about 3:45 a.m. by Misty Croslin, the then-girlfriend of Haleigh&apos;s father, Ronald Cummings.

The BBC was, at that time, screening Andes to Amazon, and police officers had the option to take non-remunerated career breaks. The scene was set for a year backpacking around South America.
