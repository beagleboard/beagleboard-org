Suddenly, the Yankees â old, feeble and scandal-ridden â have won four straight games and have played themselves back to the cusp of the periphery of the margins of the wild-card race. Theyâre just a half-game behind the Royals and 2Â½ games behind the Orioles, two of four teams they need to pass in this longshot quest.

Our campaign looks forward to debating the important issues of the day and proving why Mitch McConnell is the best person to carry Kentucky&amp;#8217;s banner in the United States Senate.&amp;#8221;
