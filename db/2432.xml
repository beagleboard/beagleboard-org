    <body>We used to work together &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/cena-voltaren-kreme-213a.pdf&quot;&gt;prix du voltarenplast&lt;/a&gt;  But to his credit, Goss didn&amp;rsquo;t resort to the traditional rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll escape routes of drink or drugs. That said, in his early days in LA, he admits his and Luke&amp;rsquo;s relationship suffered. &amp;ldquo;That was a big loss. We felt we needed a break from each other. Luke to this day is still one of my best friends.&amp;rdquo; Do they see each other regularly? &amp;ldquo;Fairly. We speak to each other &amp;ndash; we play video games nearly every night together; Bad Company,&amp;rdquo; he grins. But through it all &amp;ndash; and there was also the end, in 2010, of his 10-year relationship with the American-Cuban MTV presenter Daisy Fuentes &amp;ndash; Goss kept the faith. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s my family, and my country, that has kept me going,&amp;rdquo; he says, full of emotion. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a British man, I&amp;rsquo;m a London boy, and I&amp;rsquo;m my mother&amp;rsquo;s son.&amp;rdquo; At this, he chokes up. Recovering, he starts talking about his grandfather. One of the many tattoos on his gym-fit body is of his birth date. &amp;ldquo;He was a healer,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;I do healing.&amp;rdquo; I ask for some examples. &amp;ldquo;There was a fan that had cancer, and she asked me to give her healing. It was in the Gossy Room and I gave her healing after the show.&amp;rdquo; And she&amp;rsquo;s cured? He nods. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying it&amp;rsquo;s because of me. Maybe a state of mind. But it&amp;rsquo;s something that my granddad told me to pursue and not be ashamed of. Yeah.&amp;rdquo; I state the obvious &amp;ndash; that people will be sceptical, and take the mickey. &amp;ldquo;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give a s---,&amp;rdquo; Goss replies. &amp;ldquo;I know what I feel. And I respect sceptics. Do I want Big Foot to exist? I&amp;rsquo;d love it if Big Foot existed. Am I sceptical? Yeah.&amp;rdquo;
