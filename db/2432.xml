    <body>I&apos;m retired &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/lagliganabolacom-e0f9.pdf#gurgle&quot;&gt;betterpharmacare.net&lt;/a&gt;  Coogan said it was important to inject a note of comedy into the harrowing story â &quot;you need some relief from it â¦ to sugar the pill&quot; â but not to go too far. &quot;It was important we didn&apos;t go overboard with it. I asked Stephen [Frears] to keep an eye on me, to tell me to tone it down if my face became too animated. It was important not to trivialise it.&quot; Coogan also said he was as interested in the relationship between journalist and story as about the lost child. &quot;I wanted the film to be about him and his relationship with Philomena, and make it about a middle-aged, well educated cynic and a working-class Irish woman who was far less cynical.&quot;
