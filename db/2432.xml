 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/hygienemedicalecom-75b3.pdf&quot;&gt;seasupplements.fr&lt;/a&gt;  -- The day before Katoâs resignation, another prominent Japanese âbaseball person,â Nintendo titan Hiroshi Yamauchi, owner of the Mariners, passed away at age 85. In 1992, Yamauchi had to overcome opposition from Commissioner Fay Vincent (who had questions about foreign ownership) to purchase the Mariners. At the time, the Mariners had been unable to find a buyer willing to keep the team in Seattle, which is where Nintendoâs U.S. headquarters is located. In the 22 years he owned the team, however, Yamauchi never once saw the Mariners play in person â even last year when they opened the season in Japan against the Aâs. Yamauchiâs death further clouds an uncertain winter for the Mariners in which the jobs of GM Jack Zduriencik and president Chuck Armstrong, not to mention manager Eric Wedge, are all said to be in jeopardy. Already there is speculation the team will now be put up for sale.
