And whether they would have conquered in quite the same way without the Greek god Plant and his sublime screams is an unanswerable question. Meanwhile Reid&amp;rsquo;s own career has been a chequered one, although he became a cult figure in America and &amp;ndash; as is the way with such under-the-radar figures &amp;ndash; has enjoyed something of an autumnal resurgence, playing Glastonbury in 2009 and 2011. If his voice still sounds anything like it does on his gorgeous, addictive version of Stay with Me Baby, then his Ronnie Scott&amp;rsquo;s gigs will be something special.
