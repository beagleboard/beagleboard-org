I deposited a small check for $17.75, I made two different ATM withdrawals, I automatically transferred $1,000 to an investment account, I paid my Amex bill, I made another automatic payment which goes out every week &amp;#8212; and, on top of all that, a $250 check which I wrote on February 12 was finally cashed that day as well.
