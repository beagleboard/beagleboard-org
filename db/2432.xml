    <body>What do you do? &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?diphenhydramine.cialis.carbidopa&quot;&gt;tnmedicalselection.org&lt;/a&gt;  It&apos;s bad enough when the media does it, since they should know better. They know better because they all long ago booked their flights and rooms for a spell in Martha&apos;s Vineyard so they can chase after Obama and the rest of the first family as they try to take a short break from Washington, D.C. Everyone deserves a vacation, and not enough people get one. But that doesn&apos;t mean it makes it better for the president to stay in Washington for eight years straight without any respite at all &amp;ndash; especially when he has children who should not be punished for their parent&apos;s career choice.
