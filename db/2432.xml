    <body>I can&apos;t get a signal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcmpovos.com/supervalucom-mio-62bd.pdf&quot;&gt;supervalu.com linkedin&lt;/a&gt;  âThereâs some ambiguity at this point, and maybe through the next couple of months, there may be ambiguity beyond that, but donât think itâs going to affect our offseason planning as much as has been speculated,â Alderson said. âOne thing we have is a great deal of starting pitching depth, some of it untested at the minor league level. We have a lot of confidence in the quality and quantity of our starting pitching. Hopefully Matt is part of that rotation next year. If he is not, I donât foresee us working hard to fill this spot from outside the organization.â
