In every contest, some voters are more interested in personality than policy, and others merely register traditional party identification. Moreover, in 1932 the Republican incumbent, President Herbert Hoover, was so strongly disliked that the Democratic challenger, Roosevelt, who knew that he was running well ahead, thought it ill-advised to risk articulating controversial positions.

Alison Wolf found that of the educated women who do have children they nearly always do so within marriage; births outside wedlock amongst highly educated men and women are tiny. Essentially the ruling class is slow to proclaim the benefits of marriage in public &amp;ndash; but the always marry in private. A sort of Back to Basics in Reverse, if you will. In the 80s we had lots of Conservatives proclaiming the importance of marriage in public while having affairs in private. Now we have politicians in very stable marriages in private, but refusing the advocate its importance in public.
