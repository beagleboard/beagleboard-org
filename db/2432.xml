    <body>I study here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdesighn.com/dandelion-extract-capsules-b26f.pdf&quot;&gt;dandelion extract side effects&lt;/a&gt;  Mosquito control supervisor Todd Hanson says they already spray as if West Nile is here because it&apos;s a virus they&apos;ve encountered for the past 11 years. They urge people to take extra precautions to prevent being bitten and say the virus is more than likely in the community already. 2002 was the first year in Grand Forks County where there was a case of West Nile, and 17 people contracted the virus that year. Hanson says that two people did die from West Nile Virus and while the virus is serious, it is also preventable by limiting your chance of being bitten.
