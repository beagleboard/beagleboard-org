    <body>I wanted to live abroad &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/anaprox-rxlist-b01a.pdf#steve&quot;&gt;anaprox rxlist&lt;/a&gt;  I am so sick of people saying things like &amp;#8220;Apple created the smartphone market with its iconic iPhone, but Google&amp;#8217;s Android mobile software is now featured on three of every four smartphones sold globally.&amp;#8221; First off, my blackberry that I owned before the &amp;#8216;iconic iPhone&amp;#8217; allowed me to buy apps, play music, search the internet via a browser, had a touch screen, allowed me to check and respond to email and chat. I have had every iphone after the 3G, I didn&amp;#8217;t see a point in replacing my 3G blackberry with a slower iphone. So do not think I am bashing Apple. I just see it for what it is, someone who came into the market at the right time with just the right deals. But sorry, Star Trek had tablets and communication devices that where all touch screen way before the iphone came out&amp;#8230; So the idea is not &amp;#8216;new&amp;#8217;. It was just a matter of making it affordable.
