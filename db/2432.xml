They were in a different room from the traders, who were far more alive to the bigger picture, to their context. They knew their worth in the marketplace, down to the last penny. They understood the connection between what they did and how much money was made, and were good at exaggerating the importance of the link. Serge wasnât like that. He was a little-picture person, a narrow problem solver. âI think he didnât know his own value,â says the recruiter. âHe compensated for being narrow by being good. He was that good.â
