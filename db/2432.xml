Both satellites are equipped with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS), which allows researchers to map the global distribution and characteristics of fires in great detail. This has revolutionized knowledge about the role of fire in land cover change, ecosystem processes, and the global carbon cycle. The two MODIS sensors circle the globe every 99 minutes, providing observations four times a day on active fires, which is then relayed to forest managers around the world.
