I look like somebody that has a certain amount of haughtiness, a certain amount of arrogance&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to. People are always giving me a hard time because they&amp;rsquo;re like, &amp;lsquo;His eyes, he looks like a psychotic&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not that; I just have really strong eyes.

The beaches of Lake Balaton â Central Europe&apos;s largest â are just an hour away to the west. Within the city limits, the Hungarian capital boasts the continent&apos;s greatest selection of swimming pools. The city sits on dozens of thermal springs that supply watering holes ranging from atmospheric bathhouses dating to the time of the Turkish occupation â such as the Rudas baths built in the 1560s â to the splendid Art Nouveau spa and pools of Hotel Gellert and the vast Palatinus pool complex on Margit island in the middle of the Danube. A particular favorite is the Szechenyi baths constructed in 1913 with Hapsburg grandeur. It contains vast outdoor pools of varying temperatures, saunas, steam rooms and whirlpools. If swimming is too energetic, the chessboards set up in the thermal pools are popular in summer and winter. For the peckish, it&apos;s a short stroll through the park from the pool to the iconic Gundel restaurant, which has been serving up fine Hungarian cuisine since 1910.Â
