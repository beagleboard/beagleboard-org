    <body>I came here to study &lt;a href=&quot;http://starbizzcon.com/stmap_45db0.html?viagra.zeagra.zyrtec&quot;&gt;hormotex plus&lt;/a&gt;  DâArnaud, who had been called up Friday night to cover for John Buckâs paternity leave, got thrown right into the fire Saturday night, having to learn the Mets starter and bullpen early and quickly. He allowed three stolen bases â although one was clearly more a result of Mejiaâs delayed delivery â and was charged with a passed ball in the fifth. The catcher, who was acquired from Toronto in the R.A. Dickey trade, drew a walk in his first major league plate appearance and walked again in the eighth. He went 0-for-2, including grounding out with runners on second and third in the fifth.
