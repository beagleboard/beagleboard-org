    <body>I&apos;d like to pay this in, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/creative-pharmacy-solutions-central-llc-0a7b.pdf#silas&quot;&gt;creative pharmacy solutions central llc&lt;/a&gt;  Last year, I spent some time getting to know Lydford, a village on the edge of Dartmoor, where I was studying the war memorial. I was struck by the changes that had &amp;ndash; and hadn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; taken place in the course of a century. Physically, the place was almost the same as it appeared in pre-First World War photographs &amp;ndash; with the exception that the old barns that would once have housed animals had been converted into holiday lets. The big difference lay in the people. The men who marched off to Gallipoli and the Somme did so from cottages that were crammed with youngsters. These days, most of the residents are silver-haired.
