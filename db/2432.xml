In fact, as also can&amp;#8217;t be said too often, there are grounds for an endless argument about what exactly the Second Amendment does or does not ban. The argument that its preamble&amp;#8212;that &amp;#8220;well regulated Militia&amp;#8221; bit&amp;#8212;is meant to define the area of argument seems to many to be decisive. (Ask yourself, If there was no preamble to the Amendment and someone wanted to add it now, would the N.R.A. support or oppose it? It&amp;#8217;s obvious, isn&amp;#8217;t it?) Only recently has the Second Amendment come to mean a radical departure from previous interpretations.
