On Thursday night in the northern town of Dujail, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt in the midst of a wedding party for a Shiite family, killing nine civilians and wounding 27, a police officer said.

In the morning in Tours, he had sounded almost wistful about how, after Marcel Kittel had overpowered him to win his third stage in Tours, perhaps he had met his match in the big German. L&amp;rsquo;Equipe thinks so, identifying him as the Manxman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;bête noire&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;successeur&amp;rdquo;.

Beijing&apos;s increased presence, in turn, would drastically hamper the ability of the U.S. to hunt for contraband or to keep enemy naval assets from entering the Latin American region. It also could create the ability for the Chinese Navy to move warships into the Caribbean and the Atlantic, at will. It is also not beyond the realm of possibility that a Chinese-controlled canal, located in an openly-hostile nation like Nicaragua, could be used to facilitate staging for hostile naval or military forces.
