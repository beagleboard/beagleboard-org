    <body>I&apos;ve got a very weak signal &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/canadapharmacycom-complaints-7ef0.pdf&quot;&gt;canadapharmacy.com&lt;/a&gt;  Americans would be much better served, however, if the government taxed their health insurance (by treating it as income) and simultaneously lowered tax rates to offset the increase in their taxable income. The economy as a whole would be better served as well, with improvements in the health insurance and labor markets, as well as increased job creation and economic growth.
