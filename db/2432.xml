    <body>Do you play any instruments? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/wwwcaremed-assistancecomproviderhtml-79a8.pdf#comfortable&quot;&gt;www.caremed-assistance.com/provider.html&lt;/a&gt;  Kamran Khan said that there seems to be some confusion among the team formed to overcome the energy crisis. There are several individuals who are looking into the affairs of the Ministry of Water and Power which is the main reason of the confusion. Since the prime minister had selected Khawaja Asif to lead the Ministry of Water and Power, it was being thought that Khawaja Asif will captain the team that is to overcome the energy challenge. However, it transpired later that there are some very important personalities who are working towards that end though it is not clear yet who is doing what, but it is clearly evident now that the water and power ministry is not being steered by Khawaja Asif alone but Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Minister of State for Water and Power Abid Sher Ali, special assistant Shaukat Tareen, Adviser to PM on Water and Power Dr Mussadaq Malik and an industrialist are playing important roles in the Ministry of Water and Power.
