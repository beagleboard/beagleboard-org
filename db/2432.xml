New York-Presbyterian Hospital expanded its emergency unit with the anthrax scare in mind, making sure every room had isolation capabilities. When Rush University Medical Center in Chicago planned its new building, which opened in January 2012, the emergency department was designed to become part of the first-line response to a bioterrorism event or a pandemic. The ED rooms, usually singles, are equipped to accommodate two patients; the adjacent hospital lobby can also be used to house patients if necessary. That capability is baked into the architecture, with oxygen lines tucked into the lobby&apos;s support columns.
