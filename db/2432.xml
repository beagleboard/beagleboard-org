Obama had the upper hand in this fight from the start. He has the Constitution on his side. Republicans single out the ACA as the centerpiece of the debt. Which is asinine as any current costs or increase of the debt by ACA is nominal. They didn&amp;#8217;t offer a bill with specific spending cuts. Their sole goal was to take away something that the President fought for. In other words&amp;#8230;Obama was right. Tea Publicans tried to hold the country and the Constitution hostage over ideological disagreements. The President didn&amp;#8217;t ask Republicans for concessions to sign a debt deal. The Republicans did. And they are deservingly taking a beating for it. However, there is a spending problem in this country. The right thing to do is to take this fight to the budget process. The left and the right need to find common ground to reduce government expenditures.
