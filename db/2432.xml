HSE will be charging Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust under Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act. Gillian Astbury died on April 11 2007, of diabetic ketoacidosis, when she was an inpatient at the hospital. The immediate cause of death was the failure to administer insulin to a known diabetic patient. Our case alleges that the trust failed to devise, implement or properly manage structured and effective systems of communication for sharing patient information, including in relation to shift handovers and record-keeping.&quot;

I waded into the cool, crystal clear water not far from the Blue Point oyster beds and scooped up a couple of gallons in plastic jugs.
