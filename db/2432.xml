 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.layeredonline.com/pharmaq-uk-dd54.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmaquin for horses reviews&lt;/a&gt;  Lindsay Lohan has posed for almost as many mug shot photos as she has magazine shoots. The troubled starlet left a California courtroom in cuffs on Oct. 19 after a fed-up judge yanked her probation for blowing off court-ordered community service. She&apos;s already gone to jail three times previously, only to exit early because of overcrowding issues. A spokesman for the troubled starlet said Lohan was looking forward to her next hearing. Take a look at Lilo&apos;s bevy of mug shots ... Here, Lindsay&apos;s latest booking photo provided by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department.

When I worked as a magazine editor in my 20s, putting in regular 10-12 hour days, I used to like a little &amp;lsquo;power nap&amp;rsquo; in the afternoon. Trouble was, the only place I could get horizontal was in my employer&amp;rsquo;s reception area &amp;ndash; on a long, black leather couch. Because I ran the risk of my bosses walking in at any moment only to find me sleeping on the job, the receptionist acted as sentry, rousing me if they were approaching. But blessed with the ability to fall asleep almost anywhere, all I needed was 15-20 minutes of kip to recharge my batteries for the afternoon ahead. I could then power on, feeling renewed &amp;ndash; and I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that my productivity was hugely enhanced by having a little lie-down when my body clock craved it.

Imagine if he somehow blew a save against a team that, as of Friday, had only 51 wins and carried a 12-game losing streak into the series.
