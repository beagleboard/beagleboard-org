    <body>I&apos;d like to cancel a cheque &lt;a href=&quot;http://kssgrp.com/detain-xtm-reviews-5457.pdf&quot;&gt;detain x price&lt;/a&gt;  Since Forbes hired me in 1995 to write a legal column, Iâve taken advantage of the great freedom the magazine grants its staff, to pursue stories about everything from books to billionaires. Iâve chased South Africaâs first black billionaire through a Cape Town shopping mall while admirers flocked around him, climbed inside the hidden chamber in the home of an antiquarian arms and armor dealer atop San Franciscoâs Telegraph Hill, and sipped Chateau Latour with one of Picassoâs grandsons in the Venice art museum of French tycoon FranÃ§ois Pinault. Iâve edited the magazineâs Lifestyle section and opinion pieces by the likes of John Bogle and Gordon Bethune. As deputy leadership editor, these days I mostly write about careers and corporate social responsibility. I got my job at Forbes through a brilliant libertarian economist, Susan Lee, whom I used to put on television at MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour. Before that I covered law and lawyers for journalistic stickler, harsh taskmaster and the best teacher a young reporter could have had, Steven Brill.
