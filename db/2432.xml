Of course, they are speaking of the food and drink. Or maybe it is connected to what Wikluh Sky, frontman of Bad Copy, a Belgrade band known for its sarcastic and parodical lyrics, said at the end of his concert: âBeware of Englishmen in civvies.â He was simultaneously riffing on the preponderance of Brits and warning concert-goers about the plainclothes policemen at the festival. Embedded in his admonition is the widely-held sentiment that the festival has lost most of its rebellious spirit both because of the foreigners and the highly organized and fairly heavily policed area.

It&apos;s a shift in tone from exclusion to inclusion.&quot;
