    <body>Who do you work for? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/stmap_6ae30.html?viagra.clofazimine.lovastatin.lisinopril-hctz&quot;&gt;www.avert.org/&lt;/a&gt;  Just like the rest of us, CEOs want to be good. But all too often, the way global capitalism works requires themâif they are to serve their shareholders, keep their jobs, and, not incidentally, earn their vast paychecksâto do things that are bad for the rest of society, or at least part of it. We cannot rely on a change of heart. What we need is a change in incentives for corporate elitesânew, stricter rules, more firmly imposed, for the game that they play. And putting that system in place is a job not for the elites but for the state and societyâwhich means all of us.
