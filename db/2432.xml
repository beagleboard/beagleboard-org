That&apos;s because he is the one who signed the bill to give public employees the right to unionize. That was the monumental mistake he made. Too bad his blurred vision prevents him from seeing it.  Unions, as presently constituted and exempted from the Sherman Anti-Trust act, continue to destroy everything they touch because they never settle for a REASONABLE share of anything.  They always demand more than their share and the vast majority of Americans don&apos;t do anything to stop it because they are deceived by the union propaganda machine.

Write that all this is terrorism. To fight terrorism, Americans will permit anything. The government can read your emails and listen to your phone calls and know where you go in the car and probably how long you take in the bathroom. Thatâs okay. But stop some schmuck with orange hair from buying an assault weapon, an AR something or other, and thatâs a constitutional matter? Listen, who do you fear more â the Taliban or the NRA? Which one has cost more lives since Sept. 11? This is what you should write.â
