    <body>A packet of envelopes &lt;a href=&quot;https://newscvm.com/healthwatchcc-e9bb.pdf#allocation&quot;&gt;anabolicos.com.mx&lt;/a&gt;  The Coalition should introduce the transferable allowance as all the evidence suggests that marriage is the most secure environment in which to raise children. According to research, by a child&amp;rsquo;s seventh birthday, 31 per cent of the couples who were cohabiting when their child was nine months old had separated, compared to only 12 per cent of married parents. The Marriage Foundation found that by the time children become teenagers a full 45 per cent are not living with both parents. Of the 55 per cent who are living with both parents, 51 per cent are married. As children have a right to be cared for by both parents the state should be improving the overall chances of this happening, rather than stacking obstacles against this outcome as the current tax system does. So yes, separation and divorce happen, but marriage is the gold standard.
