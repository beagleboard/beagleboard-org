Shortstop Andrelton Simmons fielded Chris Heisey&apos;s grounder and threw slightly wide of first base, forcing Freeman to catch the ball in Heisey&apos;s path. Heisey hit Freeman&apos;s glove and was out.

Boehner suggested $800 billion in new revenues over 10 years â less than Obama wanted â in exchange for widespread spending cuts, including curbs on Medicare and Social Security.

I âwokeâ up Glass by tapping the touchpad. Then once again, using the voice command to navigate its menu: âOk, Glassââ¦âGoogle local landmarks.â I expected to see a list of places where, according to Washington Irving, the Headless Horseman claimed his territory in the 1700âs. Instead, Glass presented the Google entry for âSleepy Hollow.â While it was an accurate definition of this little town, Google Glass failed to deliver on my request. Thatâs strike number two for the pair of glasses that could âchange our lives.â
