    <body>It&apos;s OK &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcmpovos.com/cheaper-viagra-cialis-levitra-62bd.pdf&quot;&gt;online pharmacy viagra australia&lt;/a&gt;  To get his team within sight of the prize, Cook bowled Anderson for 13 successive overs in the opening session yesterday. With the second Test at Lord&amp;rsquo;s just three days away, it seemed a gamble worth taking given the prize on offer. Cook might have hastened the process had he been more aggressive with his field Â­settings and given Anderson two slips to the tail-enders rather than one. But having dropped a catch off Siddle, when he was on 10, he then caught a blinder diving to his right in Anderson&amp;rsquo;s next over when Siddle flashed again.
