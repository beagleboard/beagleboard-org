Last week David Laws, a Lib Dem education minister said that the majority of free schools had done an &amp;ldquo;absolutely fantastic&amp;rdquo; job since they were set up.

The move not only seemed uncalled for â Grunwald was praised for revamping a team that won 54 games and prevailed in a playoff series for the first time in 13 years last season â but it also drudged up memories of one of the more uncomfortable times in team history. After all, it was Mills, acting as Garden president, who suggested that Isiah Thomas be hired as team president. That decision backfired after another Knicks executive, Anucha Browne Sanders, sued Thomas and the Garden in 2006 for sexual harassment. Sanders was later awarded $11.6 million in punitive damages. So it must be asked: Now that Mills is in charge, will Thomas be welcomed back into the fold? And does this spell trouble for Knick coach Mike Woodson, a close confidante of Grunwald? Questions abound as to what this means for the Knicks.
