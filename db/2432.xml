Even if it is proven Assad and/or a top government approved the chemical attack, I have to question why the US/West must respond militarily. And this isn&amp;#8217;t because I am squeamish about the use of military force or the initiation of a war. My issue is that military force should be a last resort. In this instance, it is apparently of the first resort. What about a total Western economic embargo of the Syrian government and the areas of Syria it still controls? What about freezing all Syrian assets in US/Western banks? These are certainly viable options and would likely have a greater impact on the Syrian government, and other nations which might consider the use of chemical weapons, that would a limited military strike. And the US/Western military response will have to be limited. But, perhaps, this is more about our longer term policy of supporting a regime change in Syria, and the alleged chemcial attack is the perfect excuse for advancing that policy.
