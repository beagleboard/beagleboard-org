    <body>Who&apos;s calling? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/costco-pharmacy-salem-oregon-bf28.pdf#arrangement&quot;&gt;discount pharmacy home hill&lt;/a&gt;  They were bidding against themselves when they gave Rodriguez the dumbest contract in sports history, even as people try to tell you now what a star and a TV attraction heâs been, and itâs really not that bad. Right. Another hundred million still owed to a guy whoâs calcifying in front of our eyes. Barry Bonds at least still had his hometown fans rooting for him at the end. Who roots for A-Rod except his own lawyers and flacks and other hired friends?
