    <body>Children with disabilities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/msig-flex-health-insurance-f2ef.pdf&quot;&gt;flex health savings account&lt;/a&gt;  Moving from one place to another can be very expensive, like a big capital investment, so the risk is high, and might take years to make the move net positive, and requires in many case others to invest in your move. After a certain point, say middle age, the costs of a move are greater than the reward because it takes too long to recover the investment, so the only and thus best option is to progressively consume less into poverty. Lower wages simply mean you become poorer &amp;#8211; lower wages never make you better off, so economist argue you should be happy that your life does get a lot worse &amp;#8211; economists offer only going into poverty slowly or quickly.
