They still don&amp;#8217;t have the leadership including a fresh Board of Directors to move ahead instead of wallowing in their failure and missed opportunities. The creativity needed is already in place i.e. it e employees who are undervalued, mismanaged and blamed for the failures of the leadership and Board. Morale is so low it can crawl under the belly of an ant. It&amp;#8217;s time to reinvigorate and empower employees creating new products that will light a fire under what once was one of the finest and most creative companies in the world.

What a shame to run this magical corporation into the ground.
