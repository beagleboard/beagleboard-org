The transaction is likely to close in Q413-Q114, pending certain regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain shareholder-related matters, and will be fully debt-funded. Fitch notes that post-completion of the acquisition, Etisalat&apos;s shareholding may increase up to a maximum of 70% of MT.
