    <body>What sort of music do you like? &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/tower-healthcoukpaingone-6a83.pdf#abbey&quot;&gt;www.tower-health.co.uk/contact&lt;/a&gt;  As a Catholic physician who has met many who have been sexually abused by priests, I believe it is tragic that Pope Benedict XVI lacks insight into the great harm that he has done to victims and their families, by continuing the policies of secrecy and denial that have been part of the Vatican strategy for centuries. When known as Cardinal Ratzinger, Benedict was head of the office that dealt with clergy sex abuse cases for 24 years and then became Pope in 2005. He did nothing of any consequence to make any sexual predator clergy accountable.
