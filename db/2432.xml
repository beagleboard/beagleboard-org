    <body>How long are you planning to stay here? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/ibuprofen-dosing-pediatric-aaa8.pdf#ford&quot;&gt;ibuprofen doses chart&lt;/a&gt;  Ashlee and Pete married in 2008 and are proud parents to baby Bronx. When they split in February this year, Hollywood was shocked with the seemingly smitten couple. Announcing the split, the couple released a statement saying: &amp;lsquo;We remain friends and deeply committed and loving parents to our son Bronx, whose happiness and well-being remains our number one priority.&amp;rsquo; It didn&amp;rsquo;t last long and a custody battle was splashed all over the press. On the plus side, they both seem to have kept a dignified silence throughout proceedings, and are currently dating other partners.
