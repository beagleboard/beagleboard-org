This strongly suggests that the PET scan is a useful very early indicator for dementia. PET scans are, however, really only a research tool. But this study could lead to development of a method for the very early diagnosis of dementia &amp;#8211; long before symptoms appear. Since the currently prescribed drugs for Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s work best when given early, this research could show who could most benefit from them.

The Senate plan would fund federal agencies at current spending levels through Jan. 15 and extend the nation&amp;#8217;s borrowing authority through Feb. 7.
