Glad you caught that....I mean granted, few lawyers will work pro bono. I just get awfully tired (as do many people I know) hearing about cases where, for example, a woman&apos;s husband gets killed incongruously by a bus driver that missed a turn, and the wife sues for, you know, 30 million or so. And of course, they pretty much always say the same usual BS about &quot;it&apos;s not about the money&quot;. I figure ok, well, if it really TRULY is &apos;not about the money&apos;, then you&apos;re going to give every red cent you get to charity, right? Because like you said, &apos;it&apos;s not about the money&apos;, right? Yeah..my husband is dead, yes----and you know, the ONLY thing that will comfort me is 30 million dollars. We get so tired of hearing this kind of thing. 30 million aint gonna bring your husband back, period. ÃÂ Should she be compensated to some extent, sure. But 20 or 30 million? Come on.ÃÂ

People with that disorder can get totally debilitated. I don&apos;t know what SSA is but you must mean Social Security Disability or SSI. It is on a case by case basis whether anyone can work with that disorder.
