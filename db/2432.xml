    <body>I was born in Australia but grew up in England &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/pharma-plus-drugmarts-bf28.pdf#daughter&quot;&gt;pharma plus drugmarts&lt;/a&gt;  Patients who were refused sufficient strips were given different reasons. In more than one third of cases, NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), who control the health service budget, said the decision had been taken in order to cut costs. Other patients were told the restrictions followed were new NHS guidelines, given no explanation or told they were monitoring their care too often.
