The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Adam Giles, called critics of of the policy &quot;lefty welfare-orientated people&quot; and told them, in the bluntest terms, to get lost.

A new plan for a 4.8 million sq ft net mixed use development has been worked up and will target growing business sectors, particularly technology and new media firms as well as giving over more space to residential, which should improve integration with the local residential community and provide new cultural amenities. It is hoped that the revised planning application will be submitted by the end of the year.
