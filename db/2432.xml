    <body>I have my own business &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/boniva-cvs-79a8.pdf#asia&quot;&gt;boniva cvs&lt;/a&gt;  But what of the man-made ingredients that are so often added to processed foods &amp;ndash; Pollan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;food-like substances&amp;rdquo;? Are they really worse for us than the raw ingredients we might cook with ourselves? Take the example of the widely used and cheaply produced sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, found in biscuits, soft drinks, yogurts and bread. A Princeton study found the syrup caused rats to gain much more weight than those who were given table sugar with the same calorie intake. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that fructose itself &amp;ndash; which occurs naturally in fresh fruit &amp;ndash; is more pernicious than other sugars.
