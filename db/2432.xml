It says &amp;mdash; you have me, but first you must open me up. Common sense and extremely late-night television dictate that there is a tool for every problem &amp;mdash; for beer, we have a bottle opener. But what if we don&apos;t?

One three seats to his left, another three seats to the right, but Botte is simply not aggressive enough.

The Arkansas securities commissioner, A. Heath Abshure, said that the S.E.C., in allowing small, speculative companies and high-risk hedge funds to raise money through public advertising, had failed to ensure the integrity of the market. âYou canât just open the door of a new way of offering securities without ensuring the integrity of the market,â Mr. Abshure said. âAnd the idea that the accredited investor is a sophisticated investor is ridiculous.â
