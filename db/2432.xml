    <body>I&apos;m on work experience &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/antlerx-vitamin-shoppe-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;antlerx vitamin shoppe&lt;/a&gt;  Through 2007 and 2008, I worked a total of five bookings in Williston. Each one felt like a triumph of spirit. The tough schedule, isolation, travel time, and mood of the town and club wore me down to the point where by the Wednesday of each booking, I fantasized about leaving early. The exhaustion exacerbated everything, and at times I&amp;#8217;d snap at crude customers. Some were merely irritating, like the guys who would show up straight from work in dirty clothes and want lap dances. Some were ignorant, like the ones who would leave the rack when a black dancer came up to the stage. Some were horrifying, like the guy who told me his theory that all women secretly wanted to practice bestiality. I&amp;#8217;d leave richer at the end of the week, but I always felt like I&amp;#8217;d earned every dollar.
