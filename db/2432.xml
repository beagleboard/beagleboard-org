Soon after the attack, the Supreme Council of Kenyan Muslims condemned al-Shabaab and their actions as un-Islamic, and a week later joined in multi-faith prayers for the victims and their families. Somali clerics did the same. In early September, after an earlier attack on a restaurant in Mogadishu, 160 Somali religious scholars had issued a fatwa against al-Shabaab, saying that the organisation had no basis in Islam.
