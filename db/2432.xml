    <body>Could you give me some smaller notes? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/cialis-australia-75b3.pdf#imagination&quot;&gt;cialis australia cheap&lt;/a&gt;  1. I realize it&amp;#8217;s summertime, and maybe standards are relaxed, but, Mark Potter is identified as the editor of this copy. Couldn&amp;#8217;t he have edited this text more carefully? Couldn&amp;#8217;t the opening sentence have been been stated more clearly?! I assume the purpose was to say SteinbrÃ¼ck accused Merkel &amp;#8220;of covering up *UNTIL the looming election* the likelihood that German taxpayers will have to fund further euro zone bailouts,&amp;#8221; NOT that &amp;#8220;German taxpayers will have to fund further euro zone bailouts *DUE TO a looming election*&amp;#8221;â¦ The funding of the future bailouts doesn&amp;#8217;t result from the &amp;#8220;looming election&amp;#8221;! It&amp;#8217;s not necessitated by the &amp;#8220;looming election&amp;#8221;! He&amp;#8217;s accusing Merkel of concealing the need to fund the bailouts, and he&amp;#8217;s saying that her motive for the concealment is to hide this information from German voters until after the election. Aren&amp;#8217;t print journalists professional writers and shouldn&amp;#8217;t they strive for clarity? Aren&amp;#8217;t editors expected to compensate for inevitable &amp;#8220;goofs&amp;#8221;?
