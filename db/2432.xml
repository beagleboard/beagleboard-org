    <body>I&apos;d like to take the job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/unimedcombr-santos-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;planmed.com.br&lt;/a&gt;  As a follow-up to Chinaâs mighty urbanization policy, I gained access to a huge construction site within a new residential development zone some 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Shanghaiâs city center. My original plan was to photograph the lives of Chinese migrant workers at night. I imagined that they would probably go to some colorful places and do some interesting things after nightfall. But I was completely wrong â every day they went straight back to their dormitories, where they would eat, chat, play some poker, probably watch an outdoor movie once a month, and thatâs it!
