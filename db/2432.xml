The cancer begins in the bone marrow, where oxygen-carrying red blood cells and infection-fighting white blood cells are born. Acute lymphocytic leukemia, the most common childhood leukemia, develops when healthy white blood cells, or lymphocytes, multiply wildly and crowd out normal cells. Brain cancer, on the other hand, occurs when cancerous cells begin massing into a tumor that invades healthy brain tissue. This can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, or a change in vision, hearing, memory or balance. A relatively rare cancer overall, the rate of brain cancer has remained steady since the mid-&apos;80s when MRIs were introduced and used to diagnose the disease.
