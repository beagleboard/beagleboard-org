More permanent, and more troubling, is the way in which the bailout solidified the position of finance, a sector which at its current size acts as a private and unproductive tax on the rest of us.

In America couples with unused frozen embryos have for years been able to donate them anonymously to infertile couples through IVF clinics. Estimates put the number of babies born in this way at close to 4,500. But those who have gone through a formal adoption process are far fewer. Embryo adoption as practised by Nightlight (and so far practised only in the United States) is different in that it treats the adoption of an embryo exactly like the adoption of a baby, and a social worker employed by Nightlight will conduct a &amp;lsquo;home study&amp;rsquo; to ensure that the home is suitable for the unborn adopted child. Legally speaking, this is not adoption at all since under US law embryos are classified as property rather than people, so all that is needed is an agreement between the donor and the recipient couple. And in US case law &amp;ndash; as in Britain &amp;ndash; there is no doubt about the parenthood of the child: a woman who gives birth to a baby is the baby&amp;rsquo;s presumed mother, regardless of the origins of the embryo, and the genetic parents relinquish all parental rights. Nightlight, however, encourages an &amp;lsquo;open adoption&amp;rsquo;, in which a child grows up knowing its biological parents.

Political sources say this stance was influenced by his lawyers, keen to avoid upsetting the supreme court judges. The mercurial magnate&apos;s reaction if he is found guilty is uncertain.
