    <body>I&apos;m on work experience &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/journalmedicalthesiscom-7684.pdf&quot;&gt;yourfithealthylife.com&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8220;We are in the worst of all worlds: U.S. companies have nearly $2 trillion in cash sitting abroad because of tax burdens on bringing it home and the perception that relief may be on the way. Ideally, the international tax system should be reformed in a way that is revenue-neutral but increases the attractiveness of bringing foreign profits home. This would be accomplished by replacing the current high rate of tax levied only on repatriated profits with a much lower tax levied on all global profits. If such reform is not going to happen, this should be clarified so business does not keep planning for an amnesty that will not come.&amp;#8221;
