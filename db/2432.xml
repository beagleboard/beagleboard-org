    <body>What&apos;s the last date I can post this to  to arrive in time for Christmas? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/about-maca-magic-f2ef.pdf#disappointed&quot;&gt;about maca magic&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;Obviously, I wasn&apos;t close to myself, but I can&apos;t even look at that. I have to look at it as motivation where I got my ass kicked, and next time I&apos;m not going to let that happen,&quot; Chandler said after practice Friday in Greenburgh. &quot;Honestly, my motivation this summer was the playoff exit. I vowed to myself that I would never let that happen again. I would never let my team down and be in that situation again. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been thriving off of. I will never allow that to happen. That&apos;s been my motivation.
