All the Synergy stats say he&apos;s actually much better in the pick-and-roll than as a post guy, and it doesn&apos;t suit James Harden&apos;s game or Jeremy Lin&apos;s (or Patrick Beverley&apos;s) game at all to be these catch-and-shoot guys when they like to play fast, use the pick-and-roll, and attack the rim. If Howard wants to post up a bunch in a slowed down half-court game with the Rockets, he&apos;s in for a rude awakening and he&apos;s going to quickly run into the same issues complaining about his role, his touches and his coach in Houston that he&apos;s had in his previous two stops.
