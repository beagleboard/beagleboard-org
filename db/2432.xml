Part of the issue is the way the venomous fish feed. They are &amp;#8220;gape-limited&amp;#8221; feeders, meaning they can only eat what will fit in their mouths. However, the deep-sea lionfish are slightly larger than their shallow water counterparts. Because they can grow to 15-18 inches, and can take in prey about half their size, approximately 70 percent of the overall fish population is at risk. Not only that, but studies have confirmed that at least 40 species of native fish have experienced population drops since the lionfish were introduced.
