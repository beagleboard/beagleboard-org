    <body>I didn&apos;t go to university &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikasafloors.com/trazodone-used-for-pain-bdec.pdf&quot;&gt;trazodone side effects while pregnant&lt;/a&gt;  Her favourite recording period was in the early Seventies, when she was married to Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees and signed to a division of Atlantic records. She recorded two albums of raw, organic soul at the legendary Muscle Shoals studio in Alabama, produced by Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin, veterans of sessions with Mavis Staples, Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett. &amp;ldquo;Those are the people whose records I used to buy,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Dr John came out of rehab to play with me. When you are with good musicians, things happen.&amp;rdquo;
