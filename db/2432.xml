    <body>Another year &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?famvir.vidalista.viagra.telmisartan&quot;&gt;coward pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  To put it another way: there&amp;#8217;s a tiny subset of Ramsey clients who do invest, and nearly all of them invest less than $10,000 per year. Those people neither can nor should be shelling out $250 an hour for financial advice &amp;#8212; especially seeing as how they&amp;#8217;ve already got themselves in a pretty good place by following Dave Ramsey. What they really need is someone to talk to, someone to hold their hand and encourage them to keep on saving, even after they&amp;#8217;ve paid off their debts and built up their emergency fund.
