He was then posted to Europe and the Middle East before returning to the United States in 2001 as US State Department correspondent in Washington, DC. He was on his way to his office in the Pentagon when the building was attacked on 9/11. In Washington, Leyne covered the build-up to the Iraq war of 2003 and accompanied the US Secretary of State Colin Powell on many overseas trips.

It is also possible to restore a pension at the end of a second marriage, if the dependant would then be worse off, or be no better off, than they were before remarriage. That said, the rules on hardship definition are complicated and anyone wanting this aspect clarified should write to the office they receive their pension from. There is also information online.

When I came to America for college, I worked up to four jobs at a time to pay my way through, and graduated with student debt. Not much changed until 2010. When I moved to New York late that year, the security deposit my landlord required (in a non-fancy part of Brooklyn) was more than all my scattered savings combined â $80 more, to be precise. So I went to an ATM across the street, took $80 out of my credit card, deposited it into my checking account, and handed the whole big check to the landlord. While I&amp;#8217;ve come a long way since the end of 2010, and I&amp;#8217;m proud and relieved to report that for the first time in my life I&amp;#8217;m not perpetually broke, to peg me as a member of the 1% â &amp;#8220;outed&amp;#8221; as one â is not only absolutely ludicrous but also quite hurtful.
