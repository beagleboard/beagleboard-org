    <body>I&apos;d like to pay this cheque in, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/coats-pharmacy-coats-north-carolina-ab8a.pdf#mow&quot;&gt;coats pharmacy hours&lt;/a&gt;  I was swiftly reminded. Upon our arrival - soon after my waters broke - my husband and I were ushered to a spartan, white private room, and I was wired up to monitors to track my blood pressure and the baby&apos;s heartbeat. After two hours of contractions, I noticed the beeping had slowed. My husband summoned the midwife. She arrived instantly, checked the monitor, calmly announced: &apos;This baby needs to be out now.&apos; My obstetrician appeared like a genie. I had an emergency Caesarean thirty minutes later.
