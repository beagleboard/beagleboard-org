    <body>How much notice do you have to give? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/stmap_51680.html?theophylline.lasix.levitra.phoslo&quot;&gt;norxflonase.com&lt;/a&gt;  To get to the bottom the these long jumps, Thomas and colleagues had to first observe a certain number of bullfrogs doing what they do best: jumping. They made their way to the County Fair in Angels Camp, California to observe and record âprofessionalâ frogs and ârentalâ frogs. The professional hoppers, of course, were taking part in the competition while the rentals were merely borrowed as a control group. When the pro frogs werenât competing, Thomas set out grids to accurately measure just how far the frogs would jump. While the research team was able to coerce the rentals into hopping across the grid, the pro frog jockeys insisted on cheering their frogs across. These âjockeysâ were intent on working alone and would not allow the researchers to interfere. After recording some 3,124 bullfrog jumps, Thomas and crew retired to the lab to digitize and analyze the leaps.
