That plug-in would then insert ad slots onto the userâs browser when they went to various YouTube pages.

The French, looking to draw the Viet Minh into a decisive engagement, had parachuted thousands of soldiers into an airbase located in a valley in north-western Vietnam, on the border with Laos. They were unaware, however, that Giap too was looking for a knockout blow, and that his forces had acquired heavy artillery pieces.

The Government now appears to have permanently hung the &amp;ldquo;bargain basement sale&amp;rdquo; sign above every national treasure that foreign investors would care to buy.
