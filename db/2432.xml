Her doctor warns her against, but Kylie&apos;s dedication to the team overrules that very sound advice. It&apos;s a nice moment in terms of team spirit, but one that also calls into question the motives and judgment of Alisha and Kylie&apos;s mother. Still, the team rallies behind their hurt teammate and go on to (easily foreshadowed) glory by winning first place in their division.
