    <body>Until August &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?ofloxacin.furosemide.virility-pills.viagra&quot;&gt;how much does generic seroquel cost at walmart&lt;/a&gt;  Although growth in EM will continue to comfortably outstrip that in MAEs, we expect the growth differential to narrow between the two over the forecast horizon. Fitch has again cut its growth forecasts for all four of the BRICs. It expects growth in China to slow to 7.0% in 2014 (7.5% previously), from 7.5% in 2013; while growth in India is forecast at just 4.8% this year and 5.8% in 2014. Higher interest rates and less buoyant capital inflows will complicate policy trade-offs in many EMs, adding to growth strains from domestic structural bottlenecks, declining returns on investment and China&apos;s rebalancing.
