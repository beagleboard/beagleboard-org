    <body>Could I ask who&apos;s calling? &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelifesinsurancequotes.com/medcareusacom-6f97.pdf#legacy&quot;&gt;ukrain-drug.net&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;B.C. Hydro doesn&apos;t have a money tree, they have customers. And now (Hydro) has found another quarter-of-a-billion dollars? Who else is going to pay?&quot; Horgan also questioned why the province felt it had to pay more than $750 million for Powerex to say it had done nothing wrong. He said he was shocked to hear about the settlement, particularly after meeting earlier this year with then-minister Mike de Jong, who had agreed that the best decision was to defend B.C.&apos;s rights in the dispute.
