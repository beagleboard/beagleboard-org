As one of the main people responsible for getting the games in the first place she was on the organising committee. She was made a Dame following the Olympics and is now considered a Labour grandee, offering wise words of advice and support for Labour Leader Ed Miliband. It has been widely speculated that she will stand down at the next election, making her another contender for the London Mayoralty. Miliband would be wise to persuade her to stay and join his front bench team.
