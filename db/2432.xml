They also found that richer people tend to have higher levels of caesium and thallium, which are associated with home-grown produce. They also have higher levels of PFCs, compounds people might pick up via waterproof fabrics, as well as fresh meat, fish, and other fresh vegetables. Higher-income people, the researchers noted, are more likely to both grow produce and eat those foods. In addition, wealthier people had higher levels of a toxin called BP3 that is found in sunscreens.
