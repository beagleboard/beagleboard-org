He worked as a British Airways steward and flight dispatcher. His wife, Carole, 56, was a stewardess for the airline and a builder&apos;s daughter who descended from a family of Durham coal miners. The couple married in 1980 and bought a modest Victorian home in the countryside where they started Party Pieces, a children&apos;s partyware business that eventually made them millions. Here, Michael and Carole Middleton pose for a photograph at their home in Berkshire, southern England on November 16, 2010.
