    <body>I&apos;d like to send this letter by  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/how-much-did-the-war-on-drugs-cost-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;masters direct pharmacy discount code&lt;/a&gt;  Letâs start with the class because thatâs a much more pleasant topic as this Yankee season â and era â comes to a solemn and sad end in Houston Sunday. There was a reason those 1996-2001 Yankee teams were so special, and it wasnât just because of the four world championships and five American League pennants. They were a bunch that exemplified âteamâ and selflessness (kind of like what Joe Girardi did Thursday night when he removed himself from what could have been the most memorable moment â and photo op â of his managerial career and turned the duty of taking the ball from Rivera for the final time at Yankee Stadium to Jeter and Pettitte). And, with the exception of Pettitteâs admission of using HGH in 2002, they conducted themselves with class and dignity on and off the field. In short, they were a team that was easy to root for â unlike, for example, the classless âCowboy Up,â âIdiotâ Red Sox of Kevin Millar/Manny Ramirez &amp; Co. in 2004. And lastly, there was the endearing homegrown factor about them. Other than Paul OâNeill, the core players on those teams â Rivera, Jeter, Pettitte, Bernie Williams, Jorge Posada â all came up through the system, grew up with us, and, again with the exception of Pettitte, remained Yankees for their entire careers. It says something else about them, too, that, when their time was up as Yankees, they chose not to go someplace else just for an extra paycheck. To Yankee fans, they were more than mmjust veplayers, they were part of the family.

As far as any of that stuff, I&apos;ll let those guys take care of what they need to take care of.&quot;

But it is the possible involvement of AQIM that worries people the most.
