Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality, said in a statement. &quot;Many of our families have waited years, and in some cases decades, for the green card they need to keep their families together.

The damage got worse in 1980 when Billy registered as an agent of the Libyan government and received a $220,000 loan from the Libyans for helping facilitate oil sales.
