    <body>very best job &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/hiv-drugs-brand-generic-6a83.pdf#electric&quot;&gt;united states based online pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  Thousands were standing, screaming, waving Scottish and British flags, stepping on each otherâs feet, hanging on to each other for support, getting in each otherâs way. On the big screen attached to Court 1, you couldnât even see Murray on most points. You could only see Novak Djokovic because he was the player at the top of the screen. Sometimes, if Murray was charging to the net to reach another drop shot, you could spot him. Mostly, the fans were trying to interpret the points from Djokovicâs point of view.
