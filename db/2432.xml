    <body>Could I take your name and number, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/kosten-ethinylestradioldesogestrel-a6a4.pdf&quot;&gt;estradiol haarwasser rezeptur&lt;/a&gt;  I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you in on a guilty working secret. When I worked as a magazine editor in my 20s, putting in regular 10-12 hour days, I used to like a little &amp;lsquo;power nap&amp;rsquo; in the afternoon. Trouble was, the only place I could get horizontal was in my employer&amp;rsquo;s reception area &amp;ndash; on a long, black leather couch. Because I ran the risk of my bosses walking in at any moment only to find me sleeping on the job, the receptionist acted as sentry, rousing me if they were approaching. But blessed with the ability to fall asleep almost anywhere, all I needed was 15-20 minutes of kip to recharge my batteries for the afternoon ahead. I could then power on, feeling renewed &amp;ndash; and I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that my productivity was hugely enhanced by having a little lie-down when my body clock craved it.
