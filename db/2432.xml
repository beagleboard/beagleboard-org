Worse still, it appears Glynnâs problems arenât just technology-related, but stem from a poorly handled integration that leaves staff under threat.

Everyone wants to win but not everyone knows how. They&apos;re creative, they&apos;re intuitive and they want to get an edge in every way they can,â Lamoriello said of his new bosses. âI&apos;m comfortable with that and I&apos;m honored to be here and stay here in New Jersey with the New Jersey Devils.â

It won&amp;rsquo;t be long till &amp;ldquo;glasses-free&amp;rdquo; 3D becomes widespread. And since in the technical lingo 3D can be either &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; (shot in 3D) or &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; (applied digitally afterwards), we can look forward to issues of some selected classics with retrofitted 3D, such as Bertolucci&amp;rsquo;s The Last Emperor, screened at Cannes. When will Citizen Kane, say, famous since 1941 for its &amp;ldquo;deep-focus&amp;rdquo; effects, get the full 3D treatment?
