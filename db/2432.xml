    <body>Sorry, I&apos;m busy at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/biomedicinaesteticabmdbr-6a83.pdf&quot;&gt;m.northhollywoodpharmacy.com&lt;/a&gt;  A rarely seen &apos;Asian unicorn&apos; was captured in August in Laos but the rest of the world will never get to view him. The practically extinct animal, officially called a saola, died after being in captivity for several days, according to the Telegraph. The species is critically endangered, with anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred believed to exist in the wild. The saola is very elusive, which is why it has been compared to the unicorn. Resembling antelopes in North Africa, it&amp;#146;s actually related more closely to wild cattle. It was initially discovered in 1992 and is found in mountainous areas of Laos and Vietnam.
