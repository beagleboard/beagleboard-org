    <body>I don&apos;t like pubs &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/costco-pharmacy-hours-pocatello-92e2.pdf#unlimited&quot;&gt;walgreens pharmacy prescription club&lt;/a&gt;  Well letâs talk about the strengths of the ELAs overall and Iâll start and we can talk about the renewal cycle in particular. So as you know we have seen a strong opportunity coming into 2013 for the reasons I think weâre all aware of which is the renewal cycle for ELAs in particular from 2010 to 2013 giving us in particular I think a strong opportunity going into the back-half of 2013 and we have certainly seen that we saw that to an extent in Q2, weâre expecting to see it also going into Q4. I think the important point though as we look at 2014 is we continue to track renewal opportunities, the overall dollar value for renewals goes up just not at the same rate as it did from 2012 going into 2013. So it&apos;s going to be a driver of growth just not be [indiscernible] growth drivers we think about the opportunity ahead. I think you know the overall opportunity about ELAs as Carl talked about continues to be very strong and showing the strategic relationship, weâre engaging with the customers.
