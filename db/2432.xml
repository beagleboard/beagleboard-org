If we hadn&apos;t seen such huge price increases over the previous few months, a 1-percent monthly gain would sound like a huge increase,&quot; says Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia. &quot;But because prices have been increasing even faster in February, March, and April, the 1-percent monthly increase is a bit of a deceleration.&quot;
