I knew it was coming; us geek-types have come to expect a degree of apathy bordering on contempt for subjects close to our hearts, and I had phrased the opening part of the question in such a way as to get the House&amp;rsquo;s attention (I also, in those few seconds, coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;interstellar vandalism&amp;rdquo; which, as well as being scientifically unsound, provoked a camp chorus of &amp;ldquo;Oooooh!&amp;rdquo; from colleagues on both sides of the chamber).

Players who are clean seem to finally be realizing that both their careers and their fat wallets are threatened by cheaters who post numbers and do things that they have no hope of matching.
