    <body>Canada&gt;Canada &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?omeprazole.glyburide.viagra&quot;&gt;naprosyn costochondritis&lt;/a&gt;  Our hybrid cloud business, including VSPP grew once again at more than 100% year-over-year, following the U.S. availability of vCloud hybrid service, we recently announced the opening of our second and third data centers in the U.S. In addition, we announced our plans to bring vCloud hybrid service to the United Kingdom as data in Q4, with availability in Q1 of 2014. Customer interest remains high because VMware is the only company positioned to deliver a seamless extension from the private to the hybrid cloud. In summary, we executed against plan in Q3. Weâre pleased with our performance, but even more importantly, weâre energized by the enthusiasm coming out of our recent customer interactions at VMworld. Weâre delivering industry changing innovations in the software defined data center, hybrid cloud and end-user computing, and our customers and partners are excited to continue the journey with VMware. With that let me turn it over to Jonathan Chadwick.
