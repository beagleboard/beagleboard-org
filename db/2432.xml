    <body>I&apos;m a housewife &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/stmap_bd820.html?cialis.hydrochlorothiazide.actonel&quot;&gt;bisacodyl bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt;  Worryingly, because e-cigarettes donât contain tobacco they currently arenât subjected to the laws and regulations conventional cigarettes have to adhere to. This means no proof of age is needed to buy these devices, which come in numerous child friendly flavours such as pink bubble gum. With over 80 per cent of all smokers starting in their teens there is a real fear that e-cigarettes could provide a legal route into nicotine addiction and lead to more adult smokers, a pressure the NHS could do without. Similarly much is still unknown about e-cigarettes; no data currently exists on the long term effects of usage, while the toxin levels in emitted vapour remains uncertain. Much research is being conducted into these potential health risks, so until studies are published the jury is still out on e-cigarettes.
