    <body>I&apos;m from England &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/medicareorg-nursing-home-ratings-6ae3.pdf&quot;&gt;medicare.org&lt;/a&gt;  Karen Black would claim that her career as an A-list actress was ruined by The Day of the Locust, John Schlesinger&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of Nathanael West&amp;rsquo;s novel, in which she played a Hollywood hopeful of the 1930s using her female charms to climb to the top. Although the role won her a Golden Globe nomination, she claimed that she became the subject of malicious gossip offset. &amp;ldquo;I was a magnet for gossipers because I&amp;rsquo;m kind of flighty,&amp;rdquo; she recalled, &amp;ldquo;kind of carefree. And for some people, that equals irresponsible.&amp;rdquo; It did not help, she admitted, that she was known to be a member of the Church of Scientology.
