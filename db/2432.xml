    <body>I&apos;d like to tell you about a change of address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/newsid-medicalcom-e3c4.pdf#believed&quot;&gt;buydrugs.io&lt;/a&gt;  On 29 March the men took a bus to Barcelona. From there they flew to Casablanca and on to Istanbul. From Turkey they crossed the border for the Syrian city of Aleppo. They had been working part-time to fund their travel, though their friend is not convinced that Jean Daniel was as motivated as his brother.
