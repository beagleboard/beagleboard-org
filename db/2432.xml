After all, if the particles are there for a while, there&apos;s plenty of time to get them up to speed. But, over time, observations revealed that the radiation environment around the planet was very dynamic. This meant that something must be giving the particles their energy relatively quickly. Debate quickly split between two models: one where the particles entered the belts carrying a lot of energy, and one where they were accelerated once they entered the core of the radiation zone.
