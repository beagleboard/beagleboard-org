    <body>One moment, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/healthyindulgencesnet-213a.pdf#peaceful&quot;&gt;myhealthworld.com.au&lt;/a&gt;  Slowly, but surely and steadily - freedom is not becoming a right...it is becoming a priviledge bestowed upon us by elected and unelected entrenched bureaucrats who are VERY difficult to hold accountable (even by the ballot box).

If the goal were to report sad/offbeat stories from abroad, the media could endlessly cover Africa or the middle east, but they seem to give China (and Russia)undue coverage. I wonder what that&amp;#8217;s about.
