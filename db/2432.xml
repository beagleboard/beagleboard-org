    <body>In a meeting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/stmap_58840.html?zidovudine.levitra.palmetto&quot;&gt;venustreatments.fr&lt;/a&gt;  Holly was admitted to University Teaching Hospital, Zambia&amp;rsquo;s largest hospital, on a Tuesday in mid-July. Jess, 28, knew something was wrong with her youngest daughter days earlier. Holly had a fever, along with fits of cries and coughing, so Jess had carried her by foot to the closest clinic, one hour away. There she was given an oral rehydration solution, generic Tylenol, and an injected drug that hospital nurses later believed was an antibiotic.
