He&amp;#8217;s probably one of the shrewdest politicians ever, bar-none. To wit, even now, in his &amp;#8220;darkest hour&amp;#8221;, he seems to carry on as &amp;#8220;business as usual&amp;#8221; and even throws the ball back with &amp;#8220;If there is no reform of the justice system, we are ready for new elections&amp;#8221;.
