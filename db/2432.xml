Itâs only now, after chemical attacks last week that left hundreds dead and more traumatized, that the U.S. is moving to action. The chemical warfare became too large &amp;#8212; and calls from the United Statesâ allies too loud &amp;#8212; for the United States to remain a spectator any longer.Â So after two years of idling on Syria, itâs clear that what the U.S. is really defending is not Syrians, but the international prohibition of chemical weapons, and, most of all, its own credibility. Assad has to be punished because he clearly and publicly crossed Obama&amp;#8217;s one explicit red line &amp;#8212; however arbitrary hundreds of chemical weapons-induced deaths may seem in comparison to the 100,000-plus Syrians who have perished in the civil war.
