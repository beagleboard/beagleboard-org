Then we got word that two fires near the towns of Boise and Mountain Home, Idaho had been really demonstrating some aggressive behavior. I had a couple contacts from previous fires that I&amp;#8217;ve worked on before that were assigned to work these fires. We chatted and I was on my way first thing the next morning.
