    <body>Why did you come to ? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/doxycycline-hyclate-tablets-for-acne-6865.pdf#landing&quot;&gt;doxycycline 100mg capsules pil&lt;/a&gt;  Brooklyn: Who knew this city was so full of people with no sins in their past? Throwing the first stone has become a contest. But when it comes to Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer, how much more can be said? These two men made stupid mistakes, for sure. But they have both paid for their bad decisions and will continue to do so. Both of these men were not bad at their jobs. Neither was corrupt, neither stole money or sold their influence. In fact, if this were going on in another city, we New Yorkers would be wondering what all the fuss was about. Are we so appalled at their actions that we will cut off our noses to spite our faces? We have an opportunity to get probably the most overqualified controller in recorded political history, yet we may pass it up.
