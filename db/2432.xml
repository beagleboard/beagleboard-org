    <body>Can you put it on the scales, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/secure-paypagecom-b01a.pdf&quot;&gt;michihealth.com&lt;/a&gt;  There are many glimmers of truth â as well as what can best be described as accidental insight â in Nina Davenportâs painful but beautiful documentary about becoming a parent. Her path to motherhood was through her art, filmmaking, and so we see her figure out her desire to become a single parent (courtesy of a sperm-donor friend) and suss out her relationships to her friendsâ children, her niece and her own dad and late mom. When her son is born, small moments take on big meaning . Though Davenportâs film sometimes defines itself, uncomfortably but proudly, as video diary, the filmâs heart is hard to resist.
