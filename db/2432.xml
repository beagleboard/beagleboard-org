    <body>Thanks for calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://moultonstudio.com/commercial-disputes-and-how-to-resolve-them/#star&quot;&gt;when does risperdal consta go generic&lt;/a&gt;  In the paparazzi-crazed world of Hollywood, some stars still manage to slip away and have their special day in private. Check out the celebs who&apos;ve snuck off for a secret wedding ... Zoe Saldana got hitched! The Hollywood actress secretly wed her boyfriend, Italian artist Marco Perego, in June &amp;#151; Us Weekly reports. &quot;It was super-small but very romantic and beautiful,&quot; a source told the magazine of the quiet ceremony, which was attended by &quot;just a few&quot; close friends and relatives. While the couple is rarely photographed together, they have reportedly known each other for &quot;a long time.&quot; Perego got together with the &quot;Avatar&quot; actress shortly after her split Hollywood star, Bradley Cooper, whom she dated on-and-off for two years. Congrats, Zoe!
