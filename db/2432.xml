    <body>The manager &lt;a href=&quot;https://oporajeyo.com/stmap_bf450.html?prilosec.viagra.vermox&quot;&gt;what is clotrimazole cream usp&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;I think that&apos;s the pink elephant in the room,&quot; Rodriguez said, referring to the remaining $100 million the Yankees owe him on his $275 million deal. &quot;I think we all agree that we want to get rid of PEDs; that&apos;s a must. All the players, we feel that way. But when all this stuff is going on in the background, and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract, that&apos;s concerning for present [PLAYERS]and I think it should be concerning for future players, as well.&quot;
