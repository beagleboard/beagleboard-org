He&apos;s so beloved in the capital city that after he led Beijing to the team&apos;s first championship two years ago, the team erected a statue of him that sits outside the team&apos;s stadium, a monument to second-chances if ever there was one. Marbury&apos;s cousin, Sebastian Telfair, has also reportedly signed to play in the CBA this season for Tianjin with an eye toward returning to the NBA early next year.
