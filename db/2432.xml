He was the lone All-Star from the struggling Padres, but didn&apos;t get into the game. Cabrera said during spring training that he was &quot;a little surprised&quot; and &quot;disappointed&quot; that his name reportedly was listed in Biogenesis records, but otherwise declined specific comment. He did not say whether he had taken, purchased or received performance-enhancing drugs. He said at the time that he would fully cooperate with MLB. The 26-year-old Cabrera has been with the Padres since reaching the big leagues in 2009. He is hitting .283 and leads the National League with 37 steals. Salary lost: $348,361.

Those are both fine cars, and the Cadenza isnât that much better, and certainly isnât any cheaper, so youâll be fine. But, if you are one of the hundreds of thousands of upwardly mobile Optima and Soul owners that Kia has fought so hard to get these past few years and want a car on par with your new midlevel-management job, you really donât need to waste any time shopping around.
