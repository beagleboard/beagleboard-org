The contrast between voice and theme is an effect of Harding&amp;rsquo;s decision to have Charlie tell his own story in the past tense, a form that processes the rawest of subjects. When Charlie reports walking into a lake to drown himself, the very existence of these statements implies a counter-narrative of consciousness and purpose regained.
