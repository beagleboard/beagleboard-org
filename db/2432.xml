    <body>this post is fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/lifeaid-medical-equipment-llc-tullahoma-tn-9392.pdf#anywhere&quot;&gt;lifeaid medical equipment&lt;/a&gt;  But the main point, by Mr. El-Erian, is that we are drawing close to an emergency situation, where mass-violence is a real danger.

Erdogan is failing to realize just how broad the pushback could be if he continues to push forward with a dismissive, authoritarian stance toward the protesters. If he does so, itâs not inconceivable that heâd be out of office on this side of six months. Bottom line: Itâs fully within Erdoganâs power to salvage the situation. All it would require is acting in his own rational self-interest and walking back his actions. His recent behavior has sprung some doubts as to whether he is capable of doing so.
