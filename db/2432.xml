Nunez primarily dealt with Latin players, and was a frequent presence at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field while he worked for ACES. He was named as a defendant in MLBâs lawsuit filed earlier this year in connection with the Biogenesis matter, when baseball accused several defendants of tortious interference. Bosch was another defendant, but was dropped from the suit when he agreed to cooperate with MLB.
