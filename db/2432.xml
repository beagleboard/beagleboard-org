The moon is an intermediate goal to test landings and habitations. Mars will be the launching location for flights to the asteroid belt, an unformed planet where most ore deposits are close to the surface, don&amp;#8217;t need deep mining projects, and have weightlessness to make it easier to move ores to the surface if necessary. Rockets can be attached to bring asteroids to Mars, the Moon, or Earth. Landers, gas balloons, or parachutes can bring ores and minerals to manufacturing centers. The ores and minerals will end the need to kill millions of people in wars over raw materials because the human race will have the Moon, Mars, and an entire unformed planet&amp;#8217;s worth of ores and minerals. The US and Russia wasted themselves on a space &amp;#8220;race&amp;#8221; that ended with moon visits and the current space station that will stop working in a few years. China is building a new space station and is going to the moon and beyond while others watch. However, others can join the effort if they want to do so.
