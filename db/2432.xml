Certainly the European Policy Agreements being pushed upon Africa by the European Union are seeking advantages for Europe at the expense of America, not to mention at the continuing expense of Africa, and unless we begin to also look out for our own interests we can easily find ourselves far behind in our trade and political relationships with African nations, shut out not only by the Chinese, but especially by our allies, the Europeans. The Chinese are simply outcompeting us. The Europeans, if the EPAs are successfully foisted upon the Africans, will make it far more difficult for Americans to trade with Africa.
