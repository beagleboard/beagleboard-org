I didn&apos;t want to give you a half-answer, so I put your question to my colleague in London Luke Harding who was part of the inner team at the Guardian who worked on the WikiLeaks publications that we initiated.

The Patriots are 4-1. The Jets are 3-2. The Saints are 5-0. The Steelers are 0-4. The Patriots play the Saints at home. The Jets have the Steelers at MetLife.
