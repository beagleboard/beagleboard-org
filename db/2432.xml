This was very cheap feature phone, but I loved this device. Then I decided to buy something more modern &amp;#8211; finally Iâve selected Nokia N8, however Nokia E7 was considered too. I decided to go with N8 because of very good digital camera and some additional features, like I/O ports (HDMI etc.) and a possibility to use microSD cards. Now, I want to buy a smartphone which will combine all the features I want â and to be honest: this is the physical, real keyboard. Instead of operating system, thousands of applications, I/O ports and a nice screen, I want my keyboard experience back. A great digital camera is a very nice feature, especially for a person which donât want to have an advanced device separately, but touch-screens are unable to simulate the joy of having real keys under our fingers ï So, come back keyboards, please!
