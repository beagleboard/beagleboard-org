    <body>Is this a temporary or permanent position? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/stmap_bf280.html?aripiprazole.levitra.catapres.penisole&quot;&gt;cialis kaina&lt;/a&gt;  Can someone please explain to me how Fed policy has been any benefit to anyone except the very wealthy, Wall Street, and the banksters? Zero interest rates have made the banks incredibly rich and profitable, as has also been true with businesses in general, especially coupled with the bush tax breaks. And yet hiring rates remain low, in spite of the continued argument from the right that the financial giveaways spur growth and hiring. The Recession was declared over four years ago, and yet nothing has improved for the working (or would like to be working) middle class.
