The authors&amp;#8217; thesis appears to be &amp;#8220;people disagree, so it&amp;#8217;s not a science.&amp;#8221; Um, if this is how it works, I think someone forgot to inform Copernicus. They do have an interesting quote about how some economic disagreements can&amp;#8217;t be resolved by even the best data, but, unfortunately for the authors, I don&amp;#8217;t think that most economists would agree with the quote.

(In other words, just because you see a decent amount of economists playing armchair political philosopher doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that economics is political philosophy.)
