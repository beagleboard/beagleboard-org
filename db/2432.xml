Many educated members of the Arab elite told me, while I served as the U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan, that they were horrified by the violence in Darfur in 2003 and 2004 directed against women, children and the elderly. But Darfur was 700 miles from Khartoum, and so they did not witness the atrocities personally.
