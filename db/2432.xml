    <body>I&apos;ve come to collect a parcel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/phgh-max-recovery-a6a4.pdf#variations&quot;&gt;phgh rx where to buy&lt;/a&gt;  We have teamed up with celebrated cook and kitchenware brand, Pyrex, to offer 1 lucky reader the chance to win a Â£500 Pyrex prize package. Pyrex has been well known and loved for nearly 100 years and today, more than 75% of British kitchens are home to an item of quality kitchenware from this legendary brand. From the classic collection of glass bowls to the iconic measuring jugs including the new 0.25l size, these items are now synonymous with the British kitchen. The Pyrexperts strive to develop superior quality products which are guaranteed to provide smart solutions for all our cooking needs. From cooking, baking, picnicking and food on the move, the collection has evolved to offer a vast choice of quality products. This year, Pyrex aims to give Britain the full Pyrexperience by explaining the Pyrex difference and how items from the quality product range can enable everyone to achieve the best possible results in the kitchen, every time.
