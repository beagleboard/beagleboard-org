    <body>I&apos;m doing an internship &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/filagra-chewable-a511.pdf#motor&quot;&gt;filagra 100 efectos secundarios&lt;/a&gt;  I am sure most of these union members are otherwise decent ordinary people. However, as is almost always the case with modern day union activity, we see generally non-college educated, unskilled workers doing honest, though simple work, that anyone with a coupls days of training could do. Yet somehow, these people believe they are entitled to exorbitant wages and benefits that many highly educated, skilled, professionals would like to have. NEWSFLASH &amp;#8211; your compensation should be tied to your unique skills and ability to contribute to the operation of any given operation. Simple work = simple pay; skilled trades = better pay; professional careers after college = good pay; professional fields that require high intellect, great responsibility, and great personal risk = great pay. Sorry BART, hitting start on the train is hardly deserving of more than a modest middle income pay and platform workers should be happy with moderate levels over minmum wage. Want more money, become more valuable.
