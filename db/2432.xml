    <body>I&apos;d like to pay this cheque in, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?carbamazepine.viagra.cellcept&quot;&gt;trutein cinnabun recipes&lt;/a&gt;  Why do they keep saying &amp;#8220;glitches&amp;#8221;? A glitch is maybe my first and last name ending up in opposite fields or maybe my zipcode being assigned to a wrong geographic area. This site is essentially non-functional, stop calling it a glitch, call it what it is, a roll-out failure. I work for a major US bank and we had a major system install in Feb. It deals with hundreds of thousands of transactiona daily from across the world resulting in hundreds of billions of dollars changing hands. Yes, it had glitches like processes that were supposed to be automated needing manual intervention, butit was fully functionall and outside of a few long days by some employees, it was very smooth. This would be deemed unacceptable by any company, epacially after the amount of time and money spent. If a big bank would have had this kind of experience, the liberal media would likely still be talking about how evil and inept they are, but we didn&amp;#8217;t, BHO had this experience, and he is &amp;#8220;just working out glitches&amp;#8221;. Sad, why is the media still relevant?
