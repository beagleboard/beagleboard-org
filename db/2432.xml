He was also offered the expertise of Lebanese Army captain Joseph Wehbe, whose speciality was ballistics. Perhaps naively, Manougian says his excitement seemed to circumvent any doubts he may have had that the army was using his society&amp;rsquo;s intrepid technological adventures for its own ends.
