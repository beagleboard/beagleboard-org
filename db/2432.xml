All a CR does is simply extend the previous budget based on previous set of figures. Ask them to make this their number one priority to pass bills regarding the budget before Thanksgiving or to have it ready by then. Ask them to work across the aisle to ensure a bipartisan effort as it should be. Ask them to hold themselves accountable to our votes and send you updates of the progress. Give them feedback on what matters to you as a voter. Ensure that your vote matters. Let them know that your next vote depends on their work as a leader. A leader is not someone who simply dictates. A leader sets an example for others to follow. Google your Congressional leaders and make this happen. America can be the greatest country again but we the people need to let our voices be heard. United we stand. Divided we fall.Â
