    <body>What line of work are you in? &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/healthylifecampcom-3c56.pdf&quot;&gt;lakeshoremedarts.com&lt;/a&gt;  With traditional print and broadcast products accelerating to mobile and online platforms, web video rising as a challenger to television, and more content being distributed directly to end users, tomorrowâs strongest media companies will be those that have the foresight to invest in disruptive tools and ideas today. Bloomberg is already well underway in making these investments, largely thanks to Andy Lackâs tenure as the groupâs CEO. Over the past several years, Andy enhanced the quality of our media properties, expanded internationally, and built out services to bring Bloomberg to more people in more places, on more platforms than ever before. Weâre fortunate that Andy will be taking on the new role of Chairman of the Media Group
