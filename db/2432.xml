The actress and husband Cash Warren welcomed daughter Haven Garner Warren to their brood on Aug. 13. &amp;#145;She was born on Saturday, weighed 7 lbs. and was 19 inches long. Healthy and happy!&amp;#146; Alba, 30, wrote on her official Facebook page. &amp;#145;Big sister Honor couldn&apos;t be more excited about the new addition to our family.&amp;#146; This is the second child for the couple, who met while filming &amp;#145;Fantastic Four&amp;#146; and wed in 2008.
