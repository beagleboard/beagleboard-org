    <body>I&apos;m not sure &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/neueliebesargcom-6ae3.pdf#porridge&quot;&gt;hombrefarmacia.com&lt;/a&gt;  For customers who are considering switching accounts, though, the location of bank branches and services should be a consideration. Many people do not realise that they can use the Post Office for many banking services, which Mr French describes as &quot;a godsend&quot; for elderly and vulnerable customers. Around 95pc of personal current account customers can use the Post Office for withdrawals and 70pc can pay in cash and cheques across the counter. HSBC, which was the largest bank not to use the post office system, recently became part of this network, meaning that even more customers can use this service. As Mr French mentioned, many new entrants to banking do not use a branch network at all.
