I&apos;m a big fan of Bert &amp; Ernie and their antics. I can still sing most of the lyrics to &quot;Rubber Duckie&quot; and &quot;Doin&apos; the Pigeon&quot; from memory.

Just send some mercenaries, for Dog&amp;#8217;s sake. This prick and his friends need to disappear from the face of this earth and I don&amp;#8217;t see why regular soldiers with wives, husbands and kids have to risk their lives in this case.
