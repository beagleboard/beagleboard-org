    <body>It&apos;s funny goodluck &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jalapaoecolodge.com.br/index.php/vprx-mg-7abb.pdf#lot&quot;&gt;vprx ban o dau&lt;/a&gt;  The chief Warlord at Eglin is a 40-year-old lieutenant colonel named David Berke, a combat veteran of both Afghanistan and Iraq. As we walked around the Warlordsâ hangarâwhich for a maintenance facility is oddly pristine, like an automobile showroomâBerke made clear that he and his men are intently focused on their mission: training enough Marine pilots and maintainers to meet the 2015 deadline. Asked whether Washington-imposed urgencyârather than the actual performance of the aircraftâwas driving the effort, Berke was adamant: âMarines donât play politics. Talk to anyone in this squadron from the pilots to the maintainers. Not a single one of them will lie to protect this program.â During the day and a half I spent with the Warlords and their air-force counterparts, the Gorillas, it became clear that the men who fly the F-35 are among the best fighter jocks America has ever produced. They are smart, thoughtful, and skilledâthe proverbial tip of the spear. But I also wondered: Whereâs the rest of the spear? Why, almost two decades after the Pentagon initially bid out the program, in 1996, are they flying an aircraft whose handicaps outweigh its provenâas opposed to promisedâcapabilities? By way of comparison, it took only eight years for the Pentagon to design, build, test, qualify, and deploy a fully functional squadron of previous-generation F-16s.
