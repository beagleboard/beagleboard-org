On Saturday morning, the 6-year-old breezed four furlongs in :51.24 over Saratogaâs main track. ... Authenticity ($3) held off the late rail run by Flashy American to take the $200,000 Shuvee Handicap by a length, while Eblouissante, the half-sister to 2010 Horse of the Year Zenyatta, failed to beat a horse, suffering her first loss after winning the first two starts of her career. ... Royal Delta ($2.80), the winner of the last two editions of the Breedersâ Cup Ladiesâ Classic, returned to the winnerâs circle with a 10 3â4 length win in the Grade I Delaware Handicap at Delaware Park. The 5-year-old mare will start next in the Aug. 25 Personal Ensign Invitational at Saratoga, where sheâll likely meet Authenticity.

He genuinely seemed to be enamored with the thing, ugly and awkward as it may be. Not to knock Mr. Davis too much, but he also daily drove some of the harshest-riding, loud sporty cars this side of a racecar. So I might&apos;ve taken his opinion with a fairly large grain of rock salt.

A bogey on the first hole left him seven back with 17 to play. But Spieth forced his way into the playoff with three straight birdies. The last came when he holed out of the bunker from 44 feet, delighting a crowd that had expected to see Johnson, the hometown favorite, defend his title. Spieth caught a break when that 44-footer took a pair of fortuitous bounces.

Less than two weeks later, she refused to answer questions at a congressional hearing, citing her constitutional right not to incriminate herself.
