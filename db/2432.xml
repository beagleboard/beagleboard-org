He says it makes a difference whether marsh or reef is 10 feet or 100 feet offshore, arguing the federal government needs to invest in mapping coastal habitats.

However, to say that a foreign company &quot;imposed&quot; that in 1950 when Franco was at the height of his power is laughable. Nationalists make simplistic claims of everything bad (Madrid) and everything good (Catalan) repeatedly in media forums. English readers who are not familiar with Spanish history will learn that Spanish, Catalan and Basque capital, along with the Spanish state (50%) partnered with FIAT in creating a national car company. FIAT had long experience partnering with right wing dictatorships (Mussolini).What is clear is that the plant had the same transformative dimension in the 1950s and 1960s that Detroit did in the US. A huge number of middle class jobs were created with the direct result of a political decision in Madrid. The Catalan bourgeoisie cooperated with Franco when it suited their economic interests. The remainder of the economic statistics cited are similarly dubious and without context. Catalans pay more in taxes than they receive becuse they have higher incomes. Never expect a nationalist to remind you the balance of tax payments is worse in Madrid or the Balearic Islands though. It makes for heightened grievances to say Spain does this to Catalonia to persecute their culture.
