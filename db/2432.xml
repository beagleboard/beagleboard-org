At just £2.5m, Bolasie&amp;rsquo;s pace, strength and threat in the final third, make him a valuable addition to any team. Spanish U20 captain José Campaña (£2.6m) could also be a smart selection, for his passing ability should breed plenty of assists this season. Other alternatives in the middle include creative set piece-taker Owen Garvan (£2.7m), advanced playmaker Steven Dobbie (£2.4m) and Welsh international Jonathan Williams (£2.2m), a promising young midfielder capable of taking the Premier League by storm. Despite being Palace&amp;rsquo;s Player of the Season last year, Mile Jedinak&amp;rsquo;s (£3.1m) deep lying role and knack of picking up yellow cards means the Aussie is perhaps slightly over-priced and may not be a sensible inclusion.
