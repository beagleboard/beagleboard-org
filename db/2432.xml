I see all sorts of bad driving and riding varying from incompetence to just plain frustration. I see at least a crash per week causing disruption and anguish to those involved and involved by proxy. This is almost entirely due to lack of attention, ignorance of other road users, and just plain arrogance. As an experienced rider I have been fortunate for many years to have escaped injury through the actions of other road users poor observation but my hard earned experience has kept me safeish. We have, probably, all seen amazing sights on our commutes ranging from people eating breakfast, working on laptops, shaving, putting make up on, mobile phone use, reading papers and so on so it is hardly surprising incidents happen.

Stay safe out there.
