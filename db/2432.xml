It is important to be quick off the mark, so don&apos;t wait until they have finished flowering. Variegated plants are naturally less vigorous, and the reverted green branches will invariably grow more quickly and could take over. As for feeding, chicken manure pellets are not easy to use in containers (you can easily overdo things). I would either use slow-release granules, or rely on liquid feeds such as seaweed-based Maxicrop, following instructions to the letter. A high-potash tomato fertiliser might be appreciated once the fuchsias have started flowering each summer. Watch out for capsid bug attacks on hardy fuchsias (puckered, dotted shoot tips or leaves, and no flowers), and if you suffer one year, spray your plants with systemic Ultimate Bug Killer early the following May before the capsids arrive (and well before there are any flowers or bees on the plants).
