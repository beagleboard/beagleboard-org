    <body>I don&apos;t know what I want to do after university &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/power-pillsedcom-review-2397.pdf#as&quot;&gt;power-pillsed.com&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;We decided not to go for the project. We dropped itcompletely and so has GS Energy as we are not sure whether it isa profitable project,&quot; GS Caltex chairman Hur Dong-Soo toldreporters on the sidelines of the World Energy Congress.

These from a supposedly (conservative) beneficial global  1 degree C warming. SOL&amp;#8217;s (our named sun) magnetic weakens as it reverses, and Earth&amp;#8217;s magnetic field is also flipping (weakening) which both increase cosmic ray cloud cooling effect. Alas, to little avail against the (beneficial)  1 degree C industrial global warming. I urge the mislead people to read &amp;#8216;Rare Earth&amp;#8217;. NASA is finding millions of planetary star system, and SETI cannot find a single industrial extra terrestrial civilization; it is eerily quiet out there amongst a plethora of planetoids.
