And I think that &amp;#8216;Last Passenger&amp;#8217; had that. It reminded me of a Hitchcock thriller where Hitchcock used to invest in the characters, so whatever happened in the story, you really cared about them because he&amp;#8217;d spent the time for you, the audience, to get to know them,&amp;#8221; said Scottish actor Dougray Scott, who stars in the movie.
