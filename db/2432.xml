They are fighting a bill that would move thousands of Bedouins into government-recognized villages. Bedouins charge that the plan would confiscate their land and destroy their way of life. Israel says the moves are necessary to provide basic services that many Bedouins lack.

Levine ignores them, his face focused and sphinxlike. Sure, it&apos;s just a photo shoot. He&apos;s done plenty in his nearly 15 years as a front man for the Grammy-winning, multiplatinum band Maroon 5, and even more of them since 2011, when he took up residence as one of four coaches in comically oversized, rotating red chairs on the singing-competition show The Voice, a runaway hit for NBC.

But Berger argued that Kennedy will have an experienced staff to guide her through policy matters, while she offers other assets &amp;ndash; celebrity appeal to the Japanese, a close relationship with Obama and her gender.
