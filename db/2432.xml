With Ortiz ahead in the count 3-0, Timmons called a strike on a high pitch and then signaled strike two on a pitch that was away from the left-handed hitter. Ortiz struck out on a pitch that was in the dirt â âI donât know what to do afterward, Iâve got to swing at a pitch in the ground,â he reasoned for swinging at a pitch out of the zone â and had words with Timmons on his way back to the dugout.
