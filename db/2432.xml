Once you have signed up, the Shine team will keep in contact with you in the months before the event. A couple of weeks before the event we will let you know more details about your allocated role and your shift time. You will also receive briefing notes beforehand and a full briefing on event night. You will have a designated manager who will guide and support you at the event.
