It was played hours earlier in footballâs indoor practice facility and featured Peyton Manning, improving steadily through his rehabilitation, and several former Colt teammates. Center Jeff Saturday suited up. Receiver Brandon Stokley came. Tight end Dallas Clark appeared. Even retired offensive coordinator Tom Moore was there to call plays so Manning would hear the same voice in his helmet. It was Cutcliffeâs idea. They were all there to recreate the 2009 AFC Championship Game victory over the Jets.
