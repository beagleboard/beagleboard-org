    <body>A company car &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/what-is-celebrex-celecoxib-capsules-used-for-5522.pdf#shutdown&quot;&gt;celebrex 200mg cap price&lt;/a&gt;  I donât even think Walt is aware he is acting during the speech he gives to Jesse. He switches personas so fluidly now that it takes over his conscious mind. Each performance is its own fugue state. When he arrives at the desert, he is in Heisenberg mode, but when he leans against the car, heâs transformed into Mr. White, weaver of tales. Heâs forgotten the fight they had after Drew, and all the things he said. Now that it helps him out, in this moment, he sincerely wants to help Jesse out too. There are always seeds of truth in Waltâs lies. Thatâs why heâs able to be so convincing.
