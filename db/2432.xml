Soft boiled eggs, for example, simply need to be brought to boiling point from cold water, removed from the heat and then left to sit for 4-5 minutes depending on their size. Small new potatoes only need to be boiled for five minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and leave them to sit for 15 minutes. Similarly, carrots and other vegetables can be removed from the heat as soon as the water reaches boiling point. The golden rule for sit boiling is always to use pans with well-fitting lids and also to cut vegetables into small pieces before cooking.

When we talk about rights today, we rarely think of just how many there are, and how often they&amp;rsquo;re infringed upon or taken away. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget that the rights many take for granted are the very same others die fighting for.

Taken together with the courtâs insistence that the UK allows prisoners to vote despite Parliamentâs equally strong insistence that they should not this is a recipe for a major clash.
