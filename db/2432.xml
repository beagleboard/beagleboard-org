    <body>Hello good day &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/stmap_92e20.html?parlodel.levitra.clofazimine.yagara&quot;&gt;best thing to cut drugs with&lt;/a&gt;  The role was memorable not least because the first episode in the four-part series aired on November 18, four days before Mrs Thatcher stunned her Cabinet by announcing that she would resign as Prime Minister &amp;ldquo;as soon as a successor can be chosen&amp;rdquo;. Lyon uttered exactly the same lines, written some months earlier, in House of Cards two weeks later. He added, as Mrs Thatcher may also have done to her Cabinet colleagues, two-thirds of whom had told her she might not win if she stayed in the race: &amp;ldquo;I should like to take the opportunity of thanking you for your friendship and your loyalty at this time &amp;mdash; those who feel this description applies, of course.&amp;rdquo;
