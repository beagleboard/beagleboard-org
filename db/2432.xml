All told they examined 15 different variables: economic ones such as per capital GDP, export-import ratio, tourism, undernourishment, and energy efficiency; ecological ones like agricultural intensity, rainfall, water stress, wilderness protection, and total biodiversity; and social indicators like life expectancy, adult literacy, pesticide regulation, political stability, and female participation in national government.
