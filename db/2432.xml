Apple stock fell on Tuesday, too, after rising 11 percent in the month leading up to the announcement. Some analysts felt that Apple&apos;s lowest-priced iPhone _ $549 without a two-year cell phone contract _ isn&apos;t cheap enough to win many buyers in emerging markets.

I would love to just be home, be with my husband, be with my friends and just kind of have more of a regular schedule.&apos;&quot;

That brought Rodriguez to the plate and the loud and nasty boos came raining down once again. In other seasons, A-Rod might have come up with a big hit, but in just his third game back, the suspended and playing on appeal one-time slugger hit a weak grounder to third to end the inning.

Despite initial expectations of an accord, no agreement has been reached.

And lobbyists aren&apos;t going to get paid very much if issues are resolved and everyone is satisfied. The perpetuation of conflict is very good for the people who are billing hours consulting in any number of ways. A big industry depends on a perpetuation of conflict, and frankly, cable news depends on conflict and black-and-white assessments of reality when, in fact, Washington is a big gray area in many ways.
