He died the next day in a Richmond hospital, a bullet lodged at the base of his skull, sparking a methodical, door-to-door search for a most elusive killer: celebratory gunfire.

The fact they exploit the infrastructure like that is just disgusting! I want a cable for every single Internet-based business running from telephone pole to telephone pole. Just because the phone companies have fought every single step of development of the Internet, and depend COMPLETELY upon government protection from competition to remain in existence, that&amp;#8217;s no reason why society should expect them to contribute something. We&amp;#8217;re only talking about enabling the largest and most abundant economic opportunity for wider society that has ever been developed. The phone companies should definitely remain the sole ISPs and continue to be able to provide services like telephone and video distribution even though the Internet makes those services millions of times cheaper and easier to provide. When automobiles were developed, the government stepped in and forced automobile companies to require a buggy whip to be inserted into a special slot in the car before it could start because the buggy whip manufacturers wanted to continue making money, so they should step in again here and give the phone companies all of the benefit of connecting to the Internet even though the phone companies fought to stop it from happening!
