Thatâs why I think everything has to be taken into account when you make a suspension. Not just in this case; all the time.â

It scrambled to destroy intelligence materials, but soon discovered it wasn&apos;t well prepared for even that.

Staffers closed curtains, moved objects away from windows and transported patients to chairs in the hallways. After the tornado dealt a direct blow, destroying generators, shutting down communications, peeling off the roof, blowing out windows and turning IV poles into projectiles, they shifted into disaster mode, moving out patients who could walk and using evacuation sleds and even doors ripped from their hinges to take those who couldn&apos;t walk down as many as nine floors. Critical patients were quickly sent to another hospital; the emergency department set up operations on a safe area of the street. Afterward, people told me they &quot;knew exactly what [they] should be doing,&quot; says Dennis Manley, then director of quality and risk management for the hospital and now vice president of quality for Mercy Hospital Joplin. &quot;All that drilling and education really does pay off,&quot; he says.

Hey, remember when we used to have post offices and mailboxes and letters? No? Ask your parents.

Turkey is one of the latter. It is a country where everything is flowing, shifting. We, Turks &amp;ndash; particularly Istanbulites &amp;ndash; are a bit like passengers on a boat. We live with a dizzying feeling that the ground beneath our feet is constantly changing. Now that the sharp smell of tear gas and pepper spray has been replaced by the smell of salt and seaweed, the entire society is debating, once again: Where do we go from here? At a time like this it is worth taking a closer look at what kind of books to read about Turkey in the hope of understanding this rich country.
