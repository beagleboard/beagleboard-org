    <body>Where are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/grouppharmain-bac9.pdf&quot;&gt;phoenixpharma.info&lt;/a&gt;  Older Britons are often targeted by unscrupulous criminals - especially if they have a bit of money put away. For example, many over 50s were victims of the so-called courier scam that tricked into keying their pin numbers into their phones and handing their cards to &quot;couriers&quot; who visited their homes. It parted consumers from Â£1.5 million in under two years. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Barnard, head of the bank sponsored dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit (DCPCU), said: &quot;Many of us feel confident that we can spot fraudsters, but this type of crime can be sophisticated and could happen to anyone.&quot; The same is true of boiler room scams that target wealthier Britons with money to invest, offering &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; opportunities to snap up shares at bargain prices. Tactics to watch out for include cold calling, putting you under pressure to pay up or lose the opportunity for good, and claiming to have insider information that they are prepared to share with you.

As Southworth puts it, people view domestic abuse as &quot;a white picket fence, 2.2 children and a black eye, and they think, &apos;Why wouldn&apos;t she leave?&apos;&quot; she says. &quot;They don&apos;t understand that, in reality, the violence is often only an enforcer. It&apos;s used if the emotional abuse and the control isn&apos;t working anymore.&quot;
