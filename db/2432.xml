I well remember being treated by a Consultant that really treated me as if I had  just a bad case of sunburn which would disappear in a week or so and told me how lucky I was that I only had l5% of my body affected.  Now they discover that skin complaints not only affect the skin.  Well, well, well.  To all medical students reading this, please, I repeat Please, listen to your patients.  Ok so you may get five or six out of every ten who are looking for attention and complaining about nothing really but pleae recognise there are the remainder of that ten who are trying to get through to you  how badly they need you to hear them.
