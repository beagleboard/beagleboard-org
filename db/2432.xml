    <body>I&apos;d like to tell you about a change of address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/rockhillpharmacycom-e3c4.pdf#near&quot;&gt;health-eco.rs&lt;/a&gt;  Because the thing is, and here&amp;rsquo;s the rub, even if the deities of wisdom are predominantly female, when it comes to flesh and blood women, the tables are turned. In Ancient Greece women were thought best out of sight and out of earshot &amp;ndash; a woman considered only truly respectable if her name was never heard of and she didn&amp;rsquo;t speak out in public. The Cycladic poet Semonides wrote that the best wife was one whose husband had used a stone to dash out her tongue. Women were described as &apos;kalon kakon&apos; the beautiful evil thing &amp;ndash; evil because they were beautiful and beautiful because they were evil; men on the other hand were considered &apos;kalo&amp;rsquo;k&amp;rsquo;agathia&apos; &amp;ndash; beautiful of mind and body &amp;ndash; believed to have great minds simply because they were ripped.
