The star was arrested in Atlanta on April 19, 2013 for disorderly conduct, while her husband Jim Toth was booked for a DUI, according to a police report. Witherspoon was briefly jailed after refusing to stay inside her vehicle while Toth was given a field sobriety test by cops. In a statement, the actress apologized for her behavior, saying she was &quot;deeply embarrassed.&quot;
