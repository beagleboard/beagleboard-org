People make their own futures, and should a government or sponsor steal that future, whether it be a Russian government or American government, it is, as an athlete, the death and total demolition of a lifetime of work. Support the athletes.â

IceArizona is able to get out of its deal with Glendale after five years if the group incurs losses exceeding $50 million. That time frame lines up favorably for the group, as several locations are laying the groundwork for arena development. Kansas City, Las Vegas, Markham, Portland, Quebec City and Seattle have all been mentioned as potential future centers of NHL-caliber facilities.

Cooper was the third receiver, though Tebow&apos;s third-favorite target was his tight end, Aaron Hernandez.
