    <body>An envelope &lt;a href=&quot;https://paradiseinmexico.com.mx/standard-pharmacy-73rd-street-jackson-heights-ny-c13c.pdf&quot;&gt;tricare standard pharmacy coverage&lt;/a&gt;  Increasingly, disagreements that end in bloodshed have their origins online. The Chicago police department, which now patrols social media along with the streets, estimates that an astonishing 80 percent of all school disturbances result from online exchanges. At one point on Morgan Street, a 15-year-old joins us at the stone table. He calls himself Boss Nick, and he says he regularly posts pictures to Instagram of himself with guns. He doesn&amp;#8217;t care if the police or his teachers or really anyone sees it. He feels he has to let rivals know he is out there &amp;#8220;with these poles.&amp;#8221; Boss Nick had been friends with Shondale Gregory, known as Tooka, a 15-year-old killed in 2011. Gregory was shot in the head, and rivals soon posted pictures of his corpse to Facebook, doctoring the image with horns and splattered brains. The Chicago police said that within minutes of the images&amp;#8217; appearing on the site, 81 kids at Gregory&amp;#8217;s high school were suspended for fighting and an additional 200 students walked out. Gregory&amp;#8217;s clique of Gangster Disciples, which had called itself the St. Lawrence Boys for their block on the South Side, started referring to their turf as Tookaville and to themselves as the Tooka Gang.
