But whichever method you use, the vital thing is to ensure you have a really good through-flow of subfloor ventilation to keep the crawl space dry. This needs airbricks every three metres at front and rear. Often the original airbricks have become blocked by debris or paint, or by raised outside ground levels &amp;ndash; or maybe they weren&amp;rsquo;t even installed properly in the first place by the Victorian or Edwardian builders.
