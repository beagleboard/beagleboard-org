Can&apos;t his operation go somewhere other than a national park or forest? Not as easily as one might think. First, his guided trips are typically 40 to 100 miles long, and although state parks are an option, hiking through a national park is part of the allure of his business. Silberberg also needs to apply for permits to lead his hikers (usually about 12 per trip) and camp in the parks and wilderness areas within national forests, and the permitting offices are closed. When they do open, he doesn&apos;t expect to get his permits quickly since the offices will likely be backlogged with paperwork.

It questions the right, for example, to use aEuropean fund for tackling problem banks.
