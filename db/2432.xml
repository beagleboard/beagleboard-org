    <body>Remove card &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/viagra-nach-verfallsdatum-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;viagra nach verfallsdatum&lt;/a&gt;  The idea that a head of state can decide whom people can marry is a tawdry feudal leftover, but the problem is that the Government has decided to retain a bizarre provision that the next six people in line to the throne will still have to get the monarchâs permission to marry, which can be refused. Thatâs weird enough. But in addition itâs changed the old Act, which said that if you didnât get royal consent your marriage was null and void, with the provision that if you donât get consent you lose your place in the succession. If that had been the case in the 18th century, George IIIâs refusal to consent to his sonâs marriage would have prevented him from becoming George IV.
