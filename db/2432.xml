The investigators said the tape indicated that there were four gunshots, and not all from the same place. But Sabato concluded that the recording was flawed and he said it was wrong to use it to argue there might have been a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. However, Sabato added that, although the police recording doesn&apos;t prove it, the possibility of a conspiracy cannot be totally dismissed.
