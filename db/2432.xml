    <body>Three years &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/stmap_93920.html?cialis.differin.tolterodine&quot;&gt;menabol tablet price&lt;/a&gt;  When Duval, ranked No. 296, had an opportunity she took it, or tried. But Hantuchova had too much. Though her shots lacked the occasional flash of Duval&apos;s winners, she was consistently the better player. She dictated more, made fewer errors and moved better. In the last few games, when both players were drenched in sweat, Duval seemed more tired, scrambling to get to balls she got to easily earlier in the match, making errors as she went for shots too early in the rally.
