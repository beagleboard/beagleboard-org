    <body>We&apos;re at university together &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?satibo.sildalis.viagra&quot;&gt;edmonds pharmacy phone number&lt;/a&gt;  Nowadays the big political money machines use misdirection to redirect the public&amp;#8217;s attention from corporate America&amp;#8217;s historically large horde of cash by declaring that corporate America is overtaxed which has no basis in fact. The misdirection is working. Corporate executives and directors are reaping huge rewards. The average CEO&amp;#8217;s pay that used to average 15 times the average employee&amp;#8217;s wage since the time of Plato until the 1980&amp;#8242;s are now receiving 500 times as much and more. Directors who used to get reimbursed their travel expenses for attending quarterly meetings are now being paid one million dollars and more annually to attend quarterly meetings.
