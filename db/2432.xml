Presley holds the record for the most amount of No. 1 hits by a solo artist, in addition to a string of memorable movie roles. On August 16, 1977, Presley was found on his bathroom floor at Graceland and pronounced dead shortly. Presley, who gave his last performance in early summer 1977, had been expected to start his next tour the following day.Presley&apos;s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who was married to Michael Jackson from 1994-1996, wrote on her Myspace blog on Friday that Jackson feared he would meet the same fate as Lisa Marie&apos;s father. She referenced a conversation they had had in recent years.&apos;At some point he paused, he stared at me very intensely and he stated with an almost calm certainty, &apos;I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the way he did,&apos;&apos; Presley writes.
