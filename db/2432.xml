    <body>I&apos;m not working at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/knightspharmacygacom-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;sl-medical.gr.jp&lt;/a&gt;  Several economists are worried it won&apos;t. Growth can come from three sources: more labor, more capital, or more innovation. The 20th century was remarkable because each of these factors grew. America&apos;s final push to manufacturing, and away from agriculture, increased the use of capital. The volume and quality of labor also increased. More people than ever finished high school and went on to college, and many women joined the labor force. But we can&apos;t repeat these events. Not only that, future demographic trends are not favorable. American education isn&apos;t giving many young people the skills they need to be competitive in the global economy. An aging citizenry means a smaller share of the population will be working to support everyone else. Lower rates of economic growth will make it harder to repay America&apos;s debt - both entitlements and outstanding treasury bonds. Servicing debt will take more resources from the economy, creating a vicious cycle of high rates and low growth.
