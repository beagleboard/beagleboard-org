    <body>Do you have any exams coming up? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/photos-of-lamictal-skin-rash-bd82.pdf#donkey&quot;&gt;how much does lamotrigine cost in australia&lt;/a&gt;  There are approximately 500 car fire every day in the US. Approximately 300 deaths from car fires per year, so slightly less than one per day. No one has ever been killed in an electric vehicle. No one has ever die from Li ion batteries. Tens of thousands of people die every year in vehicle accidents and thousands have die from vehicle fires. Thousand have die from improper use of gasoline. No one has die from li ion batteries. PR nightmare? Yes, because how do you talk to the dummies that make up the good old US of A? They are incapable of rational thought or are criminally dishonest. We always do imply the it&amp;#8217;s smart to be stupid (the GOPer mantra that there is nobility in ignorance). Also, that the cheat that gets away with it is smart and admirable. How do you talk to people who would prefer to remain ignorant slaves to liars and cheats. That is us (okay, you, not me). Remain frightened america, it is in the best interest of the masters that control you.
