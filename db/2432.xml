It has brought more than 300,000 self-styled &quot;pilgrims&quot; to Rio this year.

One afternoon, I visited Leila Janah, whose startup, Samasource, builds digital outsourcing networks that help poor women and youth. (Corporations will outsource computer work anyway, she says, so why not harness the enterprise to get people living wages and teach skills?) People in the Samasource program start out doing things that can be learned with no prior computer knowledge, like tagging images for Getty and Microsoft. So far, the program has lifted fifteen thousand people above the poverty line.
