To activate the system you pull on a handle, which triggers a gas cylinder to inflate the airbags. They are designed to provide lift and allow you to move your arms and legs freely, to make swimming movements easier, keeping you near the surface of the snow. In addition, if one of the airbags is damaged during the avalanche, the other one will remain inflated. The ABS system can be bought fully integrated into a backpack or as a base unit, which can be zipped to packs of varying size by various brands.
