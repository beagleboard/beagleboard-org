The researchers identified the brain activity patterns in these animals when they touched different objects. In the first experiment, the researchers focused on the sensations the monkeys felt when they were touched on their fingers. The researchers would poke each finger and study the monkey&apos;s brain activity in response to the touches. The pokes were then replaced with electrical stimuli. The researchers implanted electrodes in the monkeys&apos; brains and systems to collect data. The researchers found that the monkeys responded in the same way to both human touch and electrical stimulation.
