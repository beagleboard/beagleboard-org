He was set to serve two years and another election was scheduled in the near future. In part because of his organizations statements and violent history, initially his election was a cause for alarm for many, both within Egypt and around the world. Regardless of concerns by many (including me), his efforts as president were consistently aimed at providing stability internally and respect internationally. He made no provocative moves toward Israel and was not advancing an anti-West agenda. Morsi was trying to establish the political legitimacy of his new, fragile government.
