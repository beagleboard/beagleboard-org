    <body>I&apos;m not interested in football &lt;a href=&quot; https://knownewbrunswick.com/contact-us/#bear &quot;&gt;atorvastatin spc&lt;/a&gt;  Below is a graph of the quits to layoffs ratio, currently at 1.5.  This ratio of people who quit their jobs vs. those who were fired gives an indicator of worker churn as well as if there might be a shortage.  If the ratio is below 1.0, this means more people are being laid off and fired than people who quit.  When the ratio is much higher, this means more people quit their jobs and thus implies there is better opportunity elsewhere and workers feel free enough to move on.  The quits to fires ratio was 1.8 in 2006.  The health care and social assistance sector has remained above 1.0 in this ratio, implying there are plenty of jobs.  The construction industry, on the other hand, has a quits to layoffs ratio of below 1.0, implying getting fired from your construction job is routine.  Here again we see a bad labor market and people don&apos;t quit because there aren&apos;t enough better opportunities.
