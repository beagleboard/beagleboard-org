The American people wants the nation&apos;s problems resolved, which requires negotiation and compromise on both sides. The longer the president holds out for everything he wants the more likely his approval numbers are to drop. In his mind he likely thinks this will help the Democrats win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014. The more likely outcome is to produce a Republican-controlled House and Senate for the last two years of his administration, rendering him an even less effective advocate for liberal policies than he already is.
