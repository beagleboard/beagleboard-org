    <body>I&apos;m happy very good site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jim.ac.in/sac/&quot;&gt;adcirca muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;  Every day I see signs of investor confidence in London &amp;ndash; and why do international companies and individuals want to put their money in the British capital? It is not just because of our bikes and our beautiful new buses. It is because of the rule of law, the absolute certainty over title, the virtual absence of corruption. They know that the British system is as transparent and honest as any on earth, and I am afraid that is not just because of the natural purity of the British soul: it is because we have a vigorous, voracious and sometimes venomous media. And that is why the ruling classes don&amp;rsquo;t dare bend the rules, in the way they do in other countries; because no one wants to be dangled before that great media beast and look into its bloodshot yellow eyes and feel the hot carnivorous breath of its displeasure.
