Data from many other albatross breeding grounds supported a picture of worldwide losses. Some species had declined by 90 per cent in 60 years. Eighteen of 22 albatross species are now considered at some risk of extinction. The figure for losses to longlining and other anthropogenic causes much used in media reportage is 100,000 dead birds annually. Coleridge&amp;rsquo;s symbol for the unity of all life is now facing oblivion worldwide, while the campaign to save albatrosses is one of the highest-profile conservation stories of our age.
