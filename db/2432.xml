    <body>Do you know the address? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/stmap_f2c20.html?bimatoprost.cialis.septra.lopressor&quot;&gt;how to get fentanyl patches online&lt;/a&gt;  Any patient with such a severe illness wants a doctor to depend on. Albin was no exception. But, she says, she was too intimidated to object to the surgeon&apos;s behavior. The surgery, performed in 2009, led to a new round of concerns. Six months later, Albin says, she began to feel as though someone were stabbing her thigh with a knife. She could no longer walk without pain, which also kept her awake at night. The surgeon told her to wait and see whether her bones would heal, but two years later it became clear that the implant was failing. Her doctor suggested more surgery, saying they would &quot;hope for the best.&quot; Ablin decided she had enough and wrote him a letter to tell him why. &quot;It was like being in a bad relationship for a long time until you finally realize you need to get out of there,&quot; says Albin, from Monterey, Calif. &quot;It was toxic, expensive and unsupportive.&quot;
