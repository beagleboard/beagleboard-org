The company said it has &amp;#8220;zero tolerance&amp;#8221; for tree contacts. Before the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which directed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) to develop mandatory and enforceable vegetation management standards, companies had their own policies, but there was no industry standard.
