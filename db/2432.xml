Secondly, some may point to the candidates themselves, arguing that Thompson, Quinn and Liu were simply not very good examples of leaders for their communities and thus couldnât command their votes in the way that, say, Dinkins did with the black vote in 1989 or Ed Koch with the Jewish vote in 1977. But thereâs something tautological about this argument: i.e., theyâre not effective leaders, because they canât deliver their communitiesâ votes becauseâ¦theyâre not effective leaders. Moreover, past candidates have performed better with equally modest community leadership credentials; in 2001, Betsy Gotbaum, whoâd been president of the New York Historical Society, received 71 percent of the womenâs vote in the runoff election for Public Advocate. And the argument would be more persuasive if these communities had other leaders who would have performed better with voters; there are none obvious on the horizon.

These students often pay for living expenses by taking out PLUS loans, which cover the difference between Stafford loans and their full financial need.
