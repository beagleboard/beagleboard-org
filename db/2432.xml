    <body>Which year are you in? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/securemedscom-review-5884.pdf&quot;&gt;securemeds.com review&lt;/a&gt;  U.S. employers in all regions of the economy plan to hire more workers during the rest of this year. The latest Manpower employment survey finds more than twice as many firms plan to add to staffing levels this fall compared to those that expect to cut jobs. &amp;#8220;Things are getting better,&amp;#8221; says Manpower&amp;#8217;s President Jonas Prising. &amp;#8220;The hiring outlook improves across the U.S. as we look into the fourth quarter, which is positive.&amp;#8221; But the growth in jobs is still not back to where it was before the recession hit in 2008. &amp;#8220;This is a very slowly improving labor market,&amp;#8221; says Prising. &amp;#8220;You could say it&amp;#8217;s unusually slow given the depth of the recession that we&amp;#8217;ve been in.&amp;#8221; While the economy has improved since the recession, &amp;#8220;At this rate it will take us close to seven or eight years to come back to the unemployment levels we had before the recession struck.&amp;#8221;

It boasts Germany&amp;rsquo;s biggest collection of museums and galleries, and the city centre is an architectural index of two dozen decades and almost as many failed political ambitions. For the best view of this symphony of stone, brick, glass and concrete, forsake the monolithic television tower (Fernsehturm) with its stuffy, tourist-packed lift and steep prices, and enjoy the open air and Prussian sky from the top of the Berlin Cathedral cupola. Sunday morning breakfast buffets are a Berlin ritual. The best is to be found at the café-restaurant Morgenland (Skalitzer Strasse 35, near Görlitzer Bahnhof U-Bahn station), but go early to avoid queuing for a table.
