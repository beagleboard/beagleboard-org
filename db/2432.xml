    <body>An estate agents &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/stmap_58840.html?sumycin.cialis.vardenafil.ddavp&quot;&gt;texhealthct.org&lt;/a&gt;  Tom told me he hated school so I asked him, was there anything the teachers could do for his behaviour to improve? &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t put me in lessons,&amp;rsquo; he said. &amp;lsquo;Give me a work placement, give me some work to do.&amp;rsquo; When I asked Tom what his ambition was he said it was to be a builder or a joiner but, heartbreakingly, he has already written off his chances. &amp;lsquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t get into college because of my behaviour record,&amp;rsquo; he said flatly, &amp;lsquo;so I will try to get into the Army.&amp;rsquo;
