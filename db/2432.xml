Think Katharine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall, Slim Keith and Lauren Hutton. Feminine, fresh, confident and effortless with exquisite tailoring and details. The precise, ever so slight puff to the sleeves on a cream silk georgette blouse, tucked into wide sand gabardine trousers with pleated legs.

The researchers estimate that the winds are expelling gas three times faster than the rate at which gas falls into the starburst region.Â Similar winds in the early Universe â the time at which the cosmos formed most of its stars â are likely to have capped the mass of galaxies. This may explain why heavy galaxies are less abundant than predicted by simple models that do not account for stellar winds.
