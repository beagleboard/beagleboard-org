    <body>Are you a student? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/canada-genericcialisorg-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;vpills.org&lt;/a&gt;  Belen, 25, was sentenced Friday to 18 years in prison and 18 years of extended supervision for the children&apos;s deaths. Judge Jeffrey Wagner said he sympathized with Belen, who had been struggling to raise four children, three of them with special needs. But he also said she had failed in her duty to take care of them. Her fourth child was visiting his father at the time of the fire.
