    <body>I live in London &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/prescription2homescom-b01a.pdf&quot;&gt;dealepharmacy.com&lt;/a&gt;  That is a reference to the two indicators â known as hospital standardised mortality ratios (HMSR) and summary hospital-level mortality indicator (SHMI) â which are used to flag up hospitals where apparently unusually high numbers of patients are dying. Both indicators were used by the Department of Health in February to justify the choice of those 14 hospitals for investigation. The 14 had had unusually high death rates in both 2010-11 and 2011-12, as judged by one or both indicators, it said.
