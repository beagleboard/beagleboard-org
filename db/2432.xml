That doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re the only target. Yes, the 2DS doesn&apos;t look nearly as convenient as the 3DS, and its screens aren&apos;t nearly as large as the 3DS XL&apos;s, but it will still play 3DS games, and that&apos;s a big plus for cash-strapped gamers who don&apos;t already have a 3DS and don&apos;t want to pay a premium for a 3D feature they&apos;ll seldom use. That means Pokemon X/Y, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Shin Megami Tensei IV, and every other game made for the 3DS and the vast majority of games made for the DS can be played on it. For cash-strapped gamers who can spend $130 on a system but can&apos;t quite justify $170 or $200, that&apos;s a huge boon.
