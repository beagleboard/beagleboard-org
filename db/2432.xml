Omnicom and Publicis are trying to take part in this technological revolution, operating âtrading desksâ that buy display ads for their clients on the new exchanges. But some big advertisers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, a consumer-goods maker, now operate their own trading desks. Media websites are increasingly, as Google does, selling their slots directly to advertising clients. Ultimately, predicts the head of advertising at a big American news firm that already sells a lot of its space through real-time bidding, âWe are not going to need the agencies.â
