    <body>Could I borrow your phone, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/lustrepharmain-7684.pdf&quot;&gt;maqsremedies.com&lt;/a&gt;  Davies and Cluzel were only tenths of a second off being out of the session, but made it in by the skin of their teeth. The same could not be said for Fixi Crescent Suzukiâs Leon Camier. The Kent rider was in the provisional pole position with ten minutes left, with his best lap of 2â18.914. He appeared to have done enough to go through to Superpole two, but as the clock ticked down the rider was not able to keep up with the pace of the others including his team-mate Cluzel and failed to progress into the next session. Camier was joined by Apriliaâs Eugene Laverty, who has struggled all the weekend with Gearbox and engine issues and could only set the twelfth fastest time, ending his chances of back to back poles. Now both lad&apos;s start the races tomorrow from row four.
