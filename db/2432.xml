Itâs a patchwork Frankenstein abortion made by writers whoâve watched enough horror to name-drop it convincingly (âSee? That kidâs supposed to be the Antichrist. Of course weâve seen âThe Omenâ). The tone is all over the chart, from camp to sleaze to gory provocation.

He had nine days off before Tuesdayâs game, but if there was any doubt that he was up to the task of facing Verlander, all you had to do was think back to his rookie season in 2002, when he and the Angels beat Barry Bondsâ Giants in Game 7 of the World Series.
