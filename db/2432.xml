Skelton had barely kayaked before, the same way that she had never really run before becoming the second women ever to complete the 78-mile Namibian ultra-run in 2009. Typically, she has done a &amp;ldquo;panic-inducing&amp;rdquo; amount of training for her final Blue Peter challenge &amp;ndash; a notorious Royal Marine endurance course - that will be aired on her very last Blue Peter show today.
