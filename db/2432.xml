    <body>I have my own business &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/my-foldaway-mirror-walmart-f2ef.pdf&quot;&gt;my foldaway mirror double offer&lt;/a&gt;  If Noel Fielding had said to me, on the first day of university, as he sat down next to me looking like a slightly wonky Evan Dando crossed with the love child of David Ginola and Bruce Forsyth: &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Noel, nice to meet you - in the next 20 years we&amp;rsquo;ll take the Edinburgh Fringe by storm, sell out Brixton Academy for a record seven nights, hang out with heroes like Tim Burgess, Gary Numan and the Beastie Boys, headline our own festival, play at the Roxy in LA in front of a very excited Robin Williams, sell out Wembley and the O2 Arena, create a bestselling book, record an album at Jimi Hendrix&amp;rsquo;s Electric Ladyland Studios in New York, have a member of Led Zeppelin tell us &amp;lsquo;You Rock!&amp;rsquo;, and spend the best part of a year touring the country having the time of our lives, partying with our mates on a tour bus bigger than this classroom,&amp;rdquo; I would probably have deemed him a complete and utter fruitloop and gone and sat somewhere else.
