When this veteran gets married, they collect a different amount, just for being married (presumably to care for their family). In her case, she did not receive the amount given to veterans who are married--because she married another woman. Nonetheless, she was legally married, and legally entitled to the higher amount, which is being given to other married veterans. The court has now determined that the VA must abide by the laws which say they must recognize all married veterans, including those who marry the same sex. Now she should be receiving the same amount as any other married vet. Therein lies the equality. Do you comprehend it now?
