Avoid thinktank suggestions about top-ups and insurance, the slippery slope which will carry us away from the founding principles of the NHS. The current way of funding the service has been repeatedly shown to be the most cost-effective and fairest.

Deal with tax avoidance and evasion, calculated to cost the country up to Â£70bn a year, enough to pay for over half the cost of the NHS. Join 11 other EU countries in adopting the Tobin tax, and assign the extra billions raised to the NHS. And if this is not enough, what do you think the public would prefer: a decent health service or Trident?

Perhaps it was before patients had anaesthesia, or at some safe point during an operation long before cardiac arrest.

He set a career high in losses after Baltimore reached him for four runs and seven hits in 7 1-3 innings of a 4-2 defeat Monday. It was the 12th consecutive outing he has yielded at least three runs, further distancing him from his previous career high of six set in 2011.
