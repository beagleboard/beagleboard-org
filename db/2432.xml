Since 1850, we have dug billions of tons of coal out of the earth, pumped trillions of barrels of oil out of the earth, pumped trillions of cubic feet of natural gas out of the earth, and burned it into the air. We have made cars into normal parts of every family and encouraged the whole world to do the same. We have taken an era that should be leading into a new ice age and changed it into an era of rising heat. These fires in the western US are more confirmations of America&amp;#8217;s power to change the world, but these changes may make America become ashes.

Bernankeâs successor might well wish that radical action had happened sooner.

There aren&amp;rsquo;t many youngsters around in the Tory Party &amp;ndash; the average age of its members is 59 &amp;ndash; but they are no more likely to favour coalition than the old-timers. Instead, the membership&amp;rsquo;s dislike of the coalition appears to be driven not just by policy concerns but by an underlying feeling that the leadership has no respect for them and that Mr Cameron in particular is too much of a centrist for their taste. Worse still, hardcore activists &amp;ndash; the 3 per cent of the membership who work more than 40 hours a month for the Party and who will presumably form the backbone of its ground campaign &amp;ndash; are more disaffected than the largely passive majority.
