Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic (RA&apos;-doh-van KA&apos;-ra-jich), one of the world&apos;s top war crimes fugitives, was arrested in a Belgrade suburb by Serbian security forces. Eric Dowling, who helped excavate tunnels used in the breakout from a World War II German prison camp that became known as the &quot;Great Escape,&quot; died in Bristol, England, a day before his 93rd birthday.

If I were to see &apos;carpaccio of mango&apos; on a restaurant menu I&apos;d run a mile. It&apos;s pretentious. Because of its associations with Harry&apos;s Bar in Venice (where carpaccio was &apos;invented&apos;), the word trails a little glamour around with it (or so restaurants seem to think) and has become a bit of a blanket term for anything raw. I&apos;m OK with it for raw fish and beef, but for fruit or vegetables there&apos;s nothing wrong with the word &apos;raw&apos;. In fact, there is a purity and honesty about it that is very satisfying.
