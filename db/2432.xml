    <body>I wanted to live abroad &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/stmap_69bc0.html?levitra.revatio.lasix&quot;&gt;pharmaphenix&lt;/a&gt;  I am passionate about investing and technology. In 2010, I co-founded Motif Investing, an innovative personal-investing site that allows you to easily invest in the latest trends and ideas. I&apos;m now the CEO. Prior to Motif, I spent over six years at Microsoft, where I started as director of corporate development and strategy, the team responsible for managing all of Microsoft&apos;s investments and acquisitions. Later I was general manager of Microsoft&apos;s Enterprise Services business. I began my career as a consultant with The Boston Consulting Group. I hold a BS in economics and engineering from Yale University, and an MBA from the Wharton School of Business. I am a member of FINRA&apos;s Small Firm Advisory Board and FINRA&apos;s Technology Advisory Committee. I love trading commodities motifs and investing in technology motifs.
