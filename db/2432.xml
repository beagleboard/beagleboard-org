I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many people actually left Dubai in the crash, but the place is still almost 90 per cent foreign national, I was told.

It&amp;#8217;s not like we aren&amp;#8217;t trying to kill the prisoner. If the drug doesn&amp;#8217;t work, shoot him and be done with it. It&amp;#8217;s an execution; the prisoner is supposed to die.
