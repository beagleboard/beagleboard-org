 &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/acheter-cialis-2206.pdf&quot;&gt;acquistare cialis generico sicuro&lt;/a&gt;  --RHP Matt Harvey had yet another sensational start Sunday afternoon, when he allowed three hits and no walks while striking out 10 over seven shutout innings in leading the Mets to a 5-0 win over the Phillies. Harvey&apos;s fastball was regularly clocked at 98 mph and he also mixed in a slider that was clocked at 93 mph as well as mid-to-high 80s curveballs and changeups. Harvey, who improved to 8-2 and lowered his ERA to 2.23, didn&apos;t allow a hit until Chase Utley&apos;s clean single with one out in the fourth, the sixth time in 20 starts this year he&apos;s opened with at least three no-hit innings. It was also the fourth time he&apos;s struck out at least 10 and walked none, but the first time he&apos;s earned a win in such a start. He is just the 10th pitcher since 1916 to have at least four starts in a season with at least 10 strikeouts and no walks. Harvey&apos;s 10 strikeouts extended his NL lead and tied him for the major league lead with the Rangers&apos; Yu Darvish.
