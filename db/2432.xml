    <body>What&apos;s the last date I can post this to  to arrive in time for Christmas? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muktiforum.com/que-es-la-pastilla-extenze-b18b.pdf&quot;&gt;que es la pastilla extenze&lt;/a&gt;  It is ironic that aircraft are becoming evermore automated and thereby making pilots evermore marginal while at the same time pilots are decrying the automation as leading to aircraft crashes. It seems doubly ironic that the current failure was apparently pilot error &amp;#8211; not using the automation properly. Although recommending more hands-on training might seem reasonable (it does to me), others might conclude that systems should design pilots out of the loop during flight transitions as equipment is not failing &amp;#8211; people are.
