Drilling for oil and gas is dangerous because of its inherent uncertainties, its subsequent production should not be. The 167 men who died deserved better â it is a source of concern that no one has ever been held to account for the failings that led to the tragedy.

In April, we documented case after case of violence by security forces against unarmed citizens, many of whom were not even participating in protests but happened to be in the vicinity. In some instances, police were overwhelmed by the number of demonstrators, and suffered casualties themselves.

Now did he miss a lot of time? He absolutely did, but we thought he could handle it. Again, itâs not that Iâm (saying), âOh hey, heâs failed.â No, that&apos;s not the case.â

The rule is intended to bar candidates from pretending to live under spending limits while having a fake outside group spend wildly on their behalf. The UFT surely looks to have done that, while also failing to report robocalls on behalf of Councilman Robert Jackson.

He&apos;s going to have an amazing career, obviously. He&apos;s an incredible talent to come on Tour at his age and have as much success as quickly as he has. So hat&apos;s off to him,&quot; Hearn said.
