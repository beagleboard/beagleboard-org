The first, and most important, is the increase in the income tax personal allowance to £10,000. It&amp;#39;s one of the main things the Lib Dems went into the coalition to achieve, and it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how much they present it as their own victory, rather than one shared with the Tories.

Notowidigdo of the University of Chicagoâs Booth School of Business in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.
