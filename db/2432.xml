You need to have you talents shaped by good teachers too. I still have a cordial email correspondence with my old history teacher, Mr Seymour, who was directly responsible for giving me the confidence to apply for and attain a place at Cambridge. (He&amp;rsquo;s still disappointed I didn&amp;rsquo;t plump for Oxford.)
