    <body>How many are there in a book? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/best-drugstore-mascara-for-length-and-volume-yahoo-a6a4.pdf#rely&quot;&gt;what are the most commonly abused types of prescription drugs&lt;/a&gt;  After the events in Egypt this past week, some in Washington are debating whether to call a coup a coup. The better question: Was the upheaval that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011 really a revolution? Think of what Egypt was before and after the fall of Mubarak, and what it is now. Before the Arab Spring the military was Egyptâs most critical political body, a stabilizing force in a country of weak politicians and weaker governance. That never changed. In fact, it hasnât changed much in the past 60 years. The same military has deposed Mohamed Mursi, and whether it did so because the people demanded it or because the military wanted it is beside the point. Mursi is gone, the Constitution offers no effective oversight of the military, and the fate of the country still rests with a few select generals.
