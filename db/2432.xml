We&amp;rsquo;ve just been making pizzas and chocolate roulade together. He wanted to put raspberries in it and I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I love they way you can load children with information when you are doing practical things with them. Their brains are just like sponges. Show them how and they pick it up so quickly. And very soon they&amp;rsquo;re telling you what to do.

On TV and in the newspapers, it was blamed for everything &amp;ndash; wrecking tourism, causing more allergies, melting ski slopes, creating snowstorms, even causing a dip in Disney&amp;rsquo;s share price.

The toll on Spitzer and his family has been horrific. He can live with that stain forever and move on or he can fight the good fight, in the same way the fighting attorney general Spitzer did when he took on the dark forces of greed. I recently read a columnist who thought that Spitzer should let someone else have a chance at public service. I think that the guy got it wrong. Spitzer did fight a heroic fight on Wall Street. I cannot think of anyone who made a mark in that area anywhere near what Spitzer achieved. The reason that so many of the good old boys are so aligned against Spitzer is that he is a man who has a penchant for upsetting the apple cart. I think that they are just plain afraid of a man who speaks his mind.
