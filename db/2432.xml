She was breastfeeding her 1-year-old daughter, Amina, in a bed in the universityâs study ward. Three days earlier, on a Tuesday, Katusime had brought Amina to the clinic because she was vomiting, feverish, and had an unusual dark yellow color to her urine. Amina tested positive for malaria and qualified for the study, which provided her with the antimalarial drug Coartem. By Friday afternoon, Aminaâs temperature had receded and she was keeping down her food. Katusime expressed her happiness at Aminaâs recovery.
