He would be praised, until his legs and his game gave out in the playoffs, for being an important figure as the Knicks won 54 games and the Atlantic Division and made it to the second round of the NBA playoffs for the first time in 13 years. But before all that he had too much to drink one night at a charity event to benefit singer Ne-Yoâs Compound Foundation, and ended up at SL East in Southampton. It was reported he had a high old time there and made what could have been a fatal decision, that he was able to drive himself home.

It&amp;#8217;s a flimsy argument. To begin with, the new process is more in line with the way companies used to go public. For instance, Apple Computer (as it was known early on) filed its S-1 on November 6, 1980. It went public on December 12th. Microsoft filed its S-1 on February 3, 1986, and went public on March 13th. In other words, about five weeks elapsed between the time these companies filed their prospectuses and went public&amp;#8212;about as long as it&amp;#8217;ll be between Twitter&amp;#8217;s official S-1 and its I.P.O.
