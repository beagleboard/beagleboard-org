Children â like adults â are increasingly trying electronic cigarettes, according to the first large national study to gauge use by middle and high school students. About 2 percent of the students said they&apos;d used an e-cigarette in the previous month, according to a survey done in 2012. That was up from 1 percent in 2011. Results were released Sept. 5 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski)
