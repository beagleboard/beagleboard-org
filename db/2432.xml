Overall household spending by this group was $37,562 in 2009, and it increased more than $1,600 a year by 2011. Total spending on insurance, however, was higher in 2009 at nearly $4,900, and thus fell by about $150 from 2009 to 2011. Health insurance spending rose a bit during this period, so the declines came in other types of insurance.
