Additionally, they used a microscopy technique that allowed them to capture high-resolution images at different depths within the biofilms, revealing details of their three-dimensional structures.

The average mall in the U.S. does not involve walking through metal detectors. It&apos;s a very soft target. The security there wouldn&apos;t be any match for a group of people with assault weapons.

It was one of four double plays for Minnesota. The Twins put three more runs up in the fourth. The first scored on a ball that dropped between second base and the mound and the other two came in when Lyle Overbay booted a bases-loaded ground ball. That made it 8-1 and though the Yanks got within 8-4 on Ichiro Suzukiâs solo homer in the seventh, the Twins got two more insurance runs, including one on a Joba Chamberlain wild pitch.
