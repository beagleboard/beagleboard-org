We can see now that when a mistake is made, there is hope that it will be addressed and put right again. âThe housing issues in the UK not only cause devastation to families but debilitate us from progress, I think the Government cannot deny now that this blanket legislation does not belong here in a nation so complex and diverse with its needs. Clearly it could never have worked.â
