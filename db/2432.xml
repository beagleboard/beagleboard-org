    <body>What qualifications have you got? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?levitra.meloxicam.paroxetine.silagra&quot;&gt;romedic.ro anunturi&lt;/a&gt;  This testimony gives us a glimpse of the terrific and inspiring man that Jackson was to those that actually knew him and were close to him. During his lifetime and still continuing 4 years later, the media has acted like tabloid media and failed to present an accurate picture of Jackson as artistic genius, humanitarian, mentor and well-loved father figure to both his own children and so many others as noted in this testimony that has been fairly presented here in this article. A few media outlets such as Ebony did behave with journalistic integrity and there are some great interviews in which Michael is asked proper questions about his creative process, what inspired him and his philosophy in life. However, most media squandered their opportunities in their interviews with him by asking inane and privacy invading questions (ie. Oprah Winfrey, Diane Sawyer, Martin Bashir, and Barbara Walters). Or worse yet, printed garbage without ever talking to him or knowing him at all.
