But what if these are the real Giants? As Bill Parcells liked to say, you are what your record says you are. There are actually more signs of collapse than recovery. For instance, they say itâs nothing but itâs rare to hear any Giant complain the way Hakeem Nicks did after last weekâs game. Meanwhile, Reid has brought a sense of professionalism and efficiency to K.C.; Arrowhead Stadium should be rocking like the old days with the Chiefs off to such a good start, and that will only make things more difficult for the Giantsâ offensive line.
