    <body>How many weeks&apos; holiday a year are there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/montelukast-side-effects-drugscom-92e2.pdf#ported&quot;&gt;montelukast side effects drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  Oakley notes that in all fairness, he had one advantage over Richter and Zeller â better technology. The version of Gardnerâs photo he looked at included vastly more detail, thanks to improved scanners that allowed for a higher-resolution image than what was possible in 2007.
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jalapaoecolodge.com.br/index.php/cymbalta-discount-program-7abb.pdf#jeweller&quot;&gt;cymbalta mg 30&lt;/a&gt;  For reasons not entirely obvious (yet another question for another day), the new rule stimulated a huge amount of stock-market trading. Much of the new volume was generated not by old-fashioned investors but by extremely fast computers controlled by high-frequency-trading firms, like Getco and Citadel and D. E. Shaw and Renaissance Capital, and the high-frequency-trading divisions of big Wall Street firms, especially Goldman Sachs. Essentially, the more places there were to trade stocks, the greater the opportunity there was for high-frequency traders to interpose themselves between buyers on one exchange and sellers on another. This was perverse. The initial promise of computer technology was to remove the intermediary from the financial market, or at least reduce the amount he could scalp from that market. The reality has turned out to be a boom in financial intermediation and an estimated take for Wall Street of somewhere between $10 and $20 billion a year, depending on whose estimates you wish to believe. As high-frequency-trading firms arenât required to disclose their profits (with the exception of public firms, like Knight, which have disclosed profits in the past), and big banks like Goldman that engage in the practice are assumed to hide their own profits on their balance sheets, no one really knows just how much money is being made. But when a single high-frequency trader is paid $75 million in cash for a single year of trading (as was Misha Malyshev in 2008, when he worked at Citadel) and then quits because he is âdissatisfied,â a new beast is afoot.
