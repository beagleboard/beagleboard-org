She would even have the right to be manipulative and seductive (I&apos;m not implying she is), without any expectation that a grown man she thinks of as an uncle would act on his animal instincts. I have no idea what their relationship was, but the responsibility would be entirely his in any imaginable scenario not crafted by some adolescent, fantastical screenwriter.
