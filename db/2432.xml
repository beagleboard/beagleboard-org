    <body>Do you know what extension he&apos;s on? &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/spedra-avanafil-costo-2206.pdf#yes&quot;&gt;stendra usage&lt;/a&gt;  Wallace&apos;s bail hearing on Thursday brought several revelations, but most important may have been the prosecution&apos;s disclosure that Ortiz, long considered the key witness in the case, changed his story with investigators. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg maintained that Ortiz had told authorities at least six times that both Hernandez and Wallace got out of a car, along with Lloyd, at the industrial park before Ortiz heard gunshots. According to Bomberg, Ortiz now says he doesn&apos;t believe Wallace got out of the car.
