There are a plethora of options for stimulating your pet mentally and physically and most are very affordable. A quick internet search should uncover the multitude of products available to keep your pet happily occupied. There are puzzles and interactive games for your pet to play and as silly as it may sound at first, could be the ticket to the preservation of your home and your petâs health. From scratching posts to remote controlled chasing toys the options are almost endless. Test out different toys either stimulated by your petâs interest in play or food. Many toys are designed for your pet to figure out how they can get the treat out of the toy which stimulates them in multiple ways. Ask your vet what you can do to stimulate your pet and ask other pet parents what tricks they use to keep their pet occupied.
