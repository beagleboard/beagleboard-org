    <body>My battery&apos;s about to run out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/sinclair-pharma-f2ef.pdf#window&quot;&gt;sinclair pharmacy dumbarton road&lt;/a&gt;  Once we pack and load the equipment onto the boats, we head towards our next destination called Wigram Island. Here the patrol discovers literally thousands of items discarded by passing vessels littering the beaches and rocky coastline including fishing nets, plastic bottles, cups and containers, countless flip-flops, buoys, channel markers, rope, boots, clothing, buckets, eating utensils, a light bulb, and even, an entire refrigerator. These extremely remote and once pristine beaches and coastal cliffs are being buried under plastic junk. We find a place to set up camp, and just minutes after doing so, Lance Corporal Vinnie Rami comes running over to me explaining he has discovered a turtleâs nest. He takes me to the spot located close to the waterâs edge, and starts digging. I have no idea how he knew the eggs were there, as there were no tracks or markings nearby. He digs about two feet down, and removes a dozen or so eggs, leaving another dozen in the ground. He gleefully cracks one egg and eats it raw, before taking the rest back to camp. I am told they taste similar to a chickenâs egg, but much more bitter. It once again reinforces the unique and extremely useful skills that these soldiers possess.
