Players no longer are afraid of Tiger. They see Tiger as a flawed human being who they can beat. The other players now raise their game as opposed to being intimidated by a super star. Because of his personal failings, Tiger is not seen as a golf God, but as a mere mortal walking through life as an imperfect human being. And this has shown up on the golf course in the Majors over the last five years. The rest of the field isn&apos;t intimidated by his large presence, and because of that they are playing at a normal or higher level.
