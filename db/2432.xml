Although Fitch considers BK&apos;s risk-adjusted ratios to be solid, the recently announced notice of proposed rulemaking on the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for large banks could have greater impact to the company. While greater clarity is needed to estimate the ratio, the company provided a loose estimate of low 4%.

No. I&apos;m talking about those invites which specifically tell you that you can&apos;t wear a certain colour, or more annoyingly, specify that you MUST wear a certain colour. Err, back off control freaks - this isn&apos;t a film set, it&apos;s your wedding down the local registery office, yeah?
