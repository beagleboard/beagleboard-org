    <body>I&apos;d like to cancel a cheque &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jalapaoecolodge.com.br/index.php/stmap_7abb0.html?ritonavir.cialis.aristocort.atenolol&quot;&gt;zydalis md&lt;/a&gt;  But I think there&apos;s another dimension more grounded in reality (and so arguably scarier) why Republican leaders might see a debt ceiling fight as better ground than a government shutdown showdown. First, we&apos;ve seen the both of these movies before. Revisionist conservatives aside, Republicans took a beating during the government shutdowns of the mid-1990s, while they managed to extract concessions from President Obama during the last debt ceiling fight. From that point of view, if you have to have a fight, it might as well be the one that &amp;ndash; from a cold political perspective &amp;ndash; turned out better than the other.
