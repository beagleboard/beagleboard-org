And we&apos;re going to have more news on this front in the fall. We continue to take steps to best position us for the future, and that includes a number of initiatives related to USA TODAY. In fact, in September last year, USA TODAY Travel launched a loyalty program called The Point, that is now in more than 3,000 hotels, all of which are part of Hilton Worldwide&apos;s 10 distinct hotel brands. Already, the program is generating 130,000 daily unique visitors. Beyond this, several other travel program partners such as Norwegian Cruise Lines and Caesars are now part of our newly launched experience sites, which enable travelers to take advantage of discounts on travel, as well as USA TODAY news and content while they are on the road. If you haven&apos;t yet experienced our experience sites, please go to our Travel portion of our USATODAY.com site for a great experience. Our relaunch of the tablet [ph] app further enhances the attractiveness of these programs, as well as the at-home news and entertainment experience.
