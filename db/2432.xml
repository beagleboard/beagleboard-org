    <body>Nice to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/maxlinepharmuz-213a.pdf&quot;&gt;healthygreenkitchen.com&lt;/a&gt;  Actually no, that is complete lying bullsh*t and you have no idea what you are talking about. Anybody who is heterosexual and already married will stay heterosexual and already married. Gays have been getting married legally in Canada and other countries for a decade now, did the world collapse around you or did you just &apos;think&quot; it collapsed around you when Obama kicked your RePUG ass twice in a row? If your marriage is on such shaky ground that the idea of two gay men or two gay women getting married and committing to spend their lives together could cause your marriage to implode, then obviously your marriage was on shaky ground to start with. Gay marriage is affecting America in countless positive ways and you can&apos;t stand that because your hate-filled homophobic bigoted generation is dying off and you are powerless to stop it and you know it.
