    <body>Accountant supermarket manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/medicalmedsonlineshopcom-69bc.pdf&quot;&gt;flyingdoctor.org.au&lt;/a&gt;  At the showâs start, Cyrus said she wouldn&apos;t apologize for that buzz-making performance, though she did promise to refrain from twerking. &quot;Now that white people are doing it,â she said, âit&apos;s kinda lame.&quot;

Polls show the coalition in a dead heat with a combination of Steinbrueck&apos;s Social Democrats, their Green allies and the hard-line Left Party â but the two center-left parties have ruled out an alliance with the latter.

Were they not aware? Of course they were. Did they just think it wouldn&amp;#8217;t affect them since they have the 1st Amendment on their side (which they should)? And is the author&amp;#8217;s point not taken? Rosen was a moron (my words, not the author&amp;#8217;s).
