The 44-year-old worked as a stockbroker before buying the post office in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, in 2003. The problems with his till started soon afterwards. &amp;ldquo;Over the 12-week period of misbalancing I made 91 telephone calls, begging for help,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;They weren&amp;rsquo;t interested.
