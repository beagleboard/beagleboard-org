    <body>I stay at home and look after the children &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/hbpharmacycouk-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;hbpharmacy.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;  With European paymaster Germany unwilling to risk a flare-upin the euro zone crisis before a national election, Greece facesits next major test in September when it must outline savingsworth 4 billion euros to bridge a fiscal gap in 2015 and 2016.
