When I came to America for college, I worked up to four jobs at a time to pay my way through, and graduated with student debt. Not much changed until 2010. When I moved to New York late that year, the security deposit my landlord required (in a non-fancy part of Brooklyn) was more than all my scattered savings combined â $80 more, to be precise. So I went to an ATM across the street, took $80 out of my credit card, deposited it into my checking account, and handed the whole big check to the landlord. While I&amp;#8217;ve come a long way since the end of 2010, and I&amp;#8217;m proud and relieved to report that for the first time in my life I&amp;#8217;m not perpetually broke, to peg me as a member of the 1% â &amp;#8220;outed&amp;#8221; as one â is not only absolutely ludicrous but also quite hurtful.

But the gain was erased by a loss of the same margin from the Greens, to 9%, according to the poll, which was conducted between Sept. 3 and Sept. 9 by the Forsa institute for Stern magazine.
