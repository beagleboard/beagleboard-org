    <body>I live here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?artane.trecator-sc.levitra&quot;&gt;longjax benefits&lt;/a&gt;  @Mike277---The reason he started living in a tiny cabin in the woods, then a flophouse, then a teepee, and finally into an underground &quot;Hobbit hole&quot; is probably because after paying child support and alimony he didn&apos;t have enough left to afford anything better. I Knew a guy who owned three building&apos;s (real Dumps) that were all one room apartments with shared bathrooms, everything included( like 120 a week) and his tenants were mostly occupied by divorced men who couldn&apos;t afford to live anywhere else. If you want to see real poverty just find a guy paying support for three kids and an ex-wife, if they get lucky they may find someone Else&apos;s ex-wife to live with so it will balance out.
