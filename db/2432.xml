He said he will not make a decision on which route to take immediately after meeting with Andrews, but maybe in a week or so after. While the organization has not conceded that Harvey will have to have the surgery, which would cost him most â if not all â of the 2014 season, some have become more resigned to that outcome. Harvey had the elbow re-examined after the initial diagnosis, a team source told The News, and gave the Mets no reason for new optimism.
