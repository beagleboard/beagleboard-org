They played games in the street, the field being a stretch of asphalt from telephone pole to telephone pole. Father served as the designated quarterback, and son sped through routes, running fly, post and hook patterns. Father wanted son to stay straight where he veered, enrolling the boy in Tae Kwon Do and establishing discipline. In his day, Senior dropped out of Curtis High, pumped gas, worked in a deli and served as a superintendent of a building in Bay Ridge before entering the police force at 26. He held his son in his hands outside Madison Square Garden the day he officially became a cop.
