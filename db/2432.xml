Mr Sobyanin was previously Mr Putin&amp;#039;s chief-of-staff and, before that, governor of the oil-rich Tyumen region in Siberia.

It was the second-largest one-yearincrease in reserves since 1970, when Alaska&apos;s giant Prudhoe Baywas sanctioned for development. Total reserves are now thehighest since 1988, according to the data.

Not only did the Scottish government&apos;s own expert welfare commission say that the present UK-wide welfare system serves Scotland well, but it concluded that there would be a serious risk to the payment of pensions in a separate Scotland. Earlier this year the SNP&apos;s own finance minister John Swinney gave the game away when one of his leaked cabinet papers questioned the sustainability of the state pension.
