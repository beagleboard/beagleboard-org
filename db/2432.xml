This is the largest civil engineering project in Europe, with a peak workforce of 14,000 engineers. After seeing the tunnel boring machine, which is 8m across and over 150m long, and which weighs a 1,000 tonnes, you cannot help but be impressed. This is engineering at its very best, working to make life better for all of us. The only limit to this success is the number of engineers that the UK can train. This is where Bloodhound is starting to make a real difference â and weâre going to do a lot more.

Ahmad then diagnosed a grade-1 (mild) strain. He had also complained of a sore quad 10 days ago in Tampa, after failing to show up for a rehab game and declining to report to Buffalo for a game the following day.

Homer&apos;s death was the third at an Atlanta stadium in the past year.
