I believe always in hard work &amp;mdash; I had to, from a young age, to improve. I always had that mentality, that when I took to the pitch I wanted to learn something new or to improve myself. If you are ready to do that, and if you want it so much, then it&amp;rsquo;s possible to stay at the top for quite long.

Its downgrade was to Aa2 â still a lot higher than Detroit&apos;s Caa3 for its general obligation bonds â but another part of the trend.
