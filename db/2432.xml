Alternatively, it recommends at least one hour and 15 minutes of vigorous activity per week.

But as a supreme witch, Fiona can pretty much do whatever she damn well pleases. Her daughter is forced to step aside as her mother strides through the old Victorian and demands the girls come on a &quot;field trip&quot; with her. Clad entirely in black, the witches saunter through the French Quarter and into a historic tour of none other than Ms. LaLaurie&apos;s opulent home. There, we learn that a voodoo witch named Marie Laveau &amp;mdash; beloved partner to the aforementioned slave killed with the severed cow&apos;s head &amp;mdash; managed to exact revenge on the savage woman by poisoning her with a fake love potion. In the final moments of the show we learn that there might have been something more mysterious in that potion, as Fiona has LaLaurie&apos;s coffin dug up only to reveal her very much alive and in chains. Fiona frees the evil woman, still clad in her puffy 1800s finery, and the two saunter off together into the New Orleans night.
