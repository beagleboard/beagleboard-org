That they have not taken root is a tribute to the fact that many of these same programs are under the protection of powerful special interest groups like labor unions and by the politicians who draw their power from their ability to oversee them. A perfect case in point is Pennsylvania, where Republican Gov. Tom Corbett has made it a priority to privatize the state-run liquor stores and the state-run distribution of distilled spirits.
