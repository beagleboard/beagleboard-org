This ensures that a copy of the program&amp;rsquo;s installation files are stored on your computer&amp;rsquo;s hard drive and it also reduces the chances of a failed installation if, for any reason the download is interrupted or corrupt. To ensure their continued well being include your saved installation files in your regular backup routine, ideally on an external hard drive or recordable discs, rather than an internal slave drive or partition on your computer&amp;rsquo;s main drive. Always store your backups separately from your PC, preferably in another location, so they will be safe in the event the computer is stolen or destroyed in a fire, for example.
