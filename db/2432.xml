He then lied about it while under oath. Do you want these two back in the White House with the potential of repeating these activities? Letâs not forget Hillary would not answer important questions about the Benghazi massacre and provided a disgraceful performance at the inquiry. Remember these words of Hillary&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;At this point what difference does it make?&amp;#8221; Show what difference all of these things make by NOT allowing her in any office or federal position EVER again.
