    <body>I&apos;ll put her on &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/medicinamexiconet-review-bf28.pdf&quot;&gt;medicinamexico.net review&lt;/a&gt;  Banks have accelerated the sales of their holdings in industrial companies this year as they seek to raise capital. We believe further divestments are likely as the banks reduce concentrations in, and manage down, their equity portfolios. Stakes with the potential for capital gains are likely to go first, but even loss-makers may be sold if capital is tight or if stipulated in restructuring programmes. Non-core industrial portfolios are common among Spanish banks and the divestment of such holdings has been a requirement in the restructuring plans of the banks that received support.
