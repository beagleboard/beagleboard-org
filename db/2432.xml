That substance is believed to be DHEA, a testosterone precursor outlawed by the WADA code and considered a controlled substance in many countries. It is available over the counter in the United States, however, and is not on MLBâs prohibited list.

In the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Lewis had won the gold medal with Johnson taking the bronze.

It sounds appealing, until actual names are attached to lifetime bans. Ryan Braun, Nelson Cruz, Jhonny Peralta and Everth Cabrera, recently suspended, are all important assets to their clubs. David Ortiz, reportedly among a group of more than 100 players who tested positive in 2003, is a folk hero in Boston. As much as the Yanks would love to see Rodriguez disappear, they are not pushing Pettitte out the door. They will be giving him the full Yankeeography treatment.
