    <body>Do you know the address? &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?perindopril.levitra.moxifloxacin&quot;&gt;buckland pharmacy belen&lt;/a&gt;  Consider the following: I needed to use Word to write a post while testing the tablet. This is a perfect use case for the Surface 2, in that I was on the go, needed to &amp;#8216;get shit done,&amp;#8217; and had a hard surface to set the device upon. The Surface 2&amp;#8242;s hardware (with new Touch Cover) was great. But Windows 8.1 got confused and displayed the desktop in a very odd manner. Word wouldn&amp;#8217;t fully expand across the screen, filling it by about 60 percent and no more. I closed, reopened, resized, and so forth, but the desktop stayed skewed and Word wouldn&amp;#8217;t open. After some frustration, I flipped the tablet to a different viewing mode, and then back to normal. That jogging of Windows 8.1 solved the problem.
