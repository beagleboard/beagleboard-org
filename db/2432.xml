    <body>I enjoy travelling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/stmap_f2c20.html?caverta.xenical.ziprasidone.viagra&quot;&gt;pharma discount review&lt;/a&gt;  * I&amp;#8217;m fascinated by the comparison of Lydia and Walt, two civilians who have descended into drug evil one step of moral compromise at a time. Where Walt acts out of hubris and pride, she acts out of caution and calculation. She doesn&amp;#8217;t want to take any risks and she doesn&amp;#8217;t want to see the consequences of her actions; and the two put together make her absolutely chilling, ordering brutal acts from a shelter of distance and euphemism. (Like Walt too, she justifies her deeds in the name of her family.) So she initially, coldly insists that Todd kill Skyler&amp;#8211;a mother like herself&amp;#8211;because she can&amp;#8217;t be exposed to the slightest risk, and tells Todd this like she&amp;#8217;s giving orders to the exterminator. I&amp;#8217;d be fascinated to see what a Breaking Bad that was centered on Lydia would look like.
