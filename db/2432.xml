The Blue Jays argued that he leaned into the pitch, but it was to no avail. After Ortiz flew out to center, Gomes got the Sox on the board with a single down the third base line that scored Drew from second and advanced Victorino to third. Nava then grounded into a 6-4-3 double play to end the inning, but the Red Sox had cut the deficit to two.
