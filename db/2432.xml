    <body>perfect design thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://paradiseinmexico.com.mx/rxreliefcardcom-c13c.pdf#naturalists&quot;&gt;rxreliefcard.com/vfw&lt;/a&gt;  I find it hilarious that everyone is talking a out the bengals as the best team in the AFC. Sure they have a good defense but they have an amemic offense. Essentially the bengals are a poor mans Houston Texans. Both have solid defense, but lack elite qbs that play well against good teams. Both Schaub and Dalton have noodle arms and benefit greatly from playing with a top 5 outside Numbers WR, and a good running game they can hit play action off of. When either are forced to throw the ball to win, they fail. So since Houston has beat Cincy 2 years in a row, and then has gotten obliterated by Baltimore and New England each year respectively , I think I&amp;#8217;ll stick the the Pats and Bal as the top 2, with Denver pushing hard.
