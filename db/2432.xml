Do rules governing interstate commerce allow California to impose a special tax on out of state groups coming here to file frivolous legal actions? We can turn this into a major revenue opportunity..

A skort is more usually found on hockey and tennis players but forget their sporty past and embrace their fashion future. With the bonus of them being shorts you can feel safe in the knowledge that you won&amp;#39;t suffer from a Marilyn Monroe moment and can dance the night away without anyone getting a glance of your underwear.
