 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/all-natural-pill-like-viagra-f2ef.pdf&quot;&gt;what if viagra doesnt work&lt;/a&gt;  Today I am in the Senate testifying before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on proposed legislation to shift some of the federal revenues collected from offshore energy development to a handful of the &quot;closest&quot; coastal states for energy produced in federal waters (more than six miles off the coast) &amp;ndash; usually in the form of oil and gas drilling, and, more recently, from wind and other renewable energy sources. The bipartisan bill I am testifying about has the somewhat Orwellian name of the FAIR Act (S. 1273) and is not surprisingly led by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Lisa Murkowski R-Alaska, whose states stand to gain mightily from the bill&apos;s passage. This isn&apos;t the first &amp;ndash; or I suspect the last &amp;ndash; ill-conceived proposal to shift these revenues from the federal treasury to the states. Why is this a bad deal for taxpayers? The short answer is that revenue-sharing provisions like the ones in S. 1273 un-FAIR-ly divert billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury to states. Not only is this bad policy, in today&apos;s fiscal climate it is downright foolish.
