A rep for the reality starlet told Us Weekly the affair was &quot;a million dollar princess wedding.&quot; The fairytale nuptials took place on June 13, 2013 at the Park Hyatt Aviara in Carlsbad, Calif. more than three years after the couple first got engaged. Krupa&apos;s Bravo costars were reportedly guests at the wedding and the happy event was filmed for the third season of &quot;Housewives.&quot; The 34-year-old blond bombshell reportedly wore a $30,000 strapless Swarovski crystal encrusted Chagoury Couture dress with a sweetheart neckline, never-ending ruffles and a high-low hemline.
