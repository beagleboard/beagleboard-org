    <body>What part of  do you come from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/supplementsandmecom-f2ef.pdf&quot;&gt;med7health24.com&lt;/a&gt;  BOSTON &gt;&gt; Walking back to his Fenway Park office after the traditional Patriots Day morning Red Sox game, Charles Steinberg saw the reports on TV that there had been explosions at the Boston Marathon finish line.

But on small cap and lightly traded stocks, if you want to buy more than a token amount, it can be difficult to find a bid or a seller. Usually it will be 100X100. You can put in a market order, and sometimes get a very bad price. You can put in a limit order and watch the market move against you. So no, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t say things have improved for small investors. It used to be that you could put in a market order for a large amount of a thinly traded stock a (say 10000 shares of a stock that trades 60000/day) and immediately get filled pretty close to the last price. That is no longer the case. Market making has dried up, meaning that each investor is left to match wits with the bots. That can be hit or miss, depending on the time of day and the trading volume. I&amp;#8217;ve had the bots sometimes try to figure out if I&amp;#8217;m a bot too, and get filled on one share of my orders, meaning that I get charged full commission for a one share fill. So things are screwed up in some ways and going back to the old market making model with wider bid offer but real bids and offers is a good idea, imo.

He also has real estate holdings, a construction company, Newport Property Construction, and a Mercedes-Benz dealership in League City, Texas, near Houston.
