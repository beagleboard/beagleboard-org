Now the carrier has filed its latest color-protecting complaint against AT&amp;T, alleging in a suit on Friday that its competitor&apos;s new subsidiary, Aio Wireless, is using its own trademarked color to confuse consumers. &quot;Out of all of the colors in the universe,&quot; T-Mobile&apos;s complaint reads, &quot;[Aio] chose magenta.&quot;
