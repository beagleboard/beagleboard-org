This is 300kcal, where they can be up to 500kcal, but it has triple the saturated fat content of a standard tuna sandwich and almost a third of your daily guideline salt, easily boosted to almost half your salt intake if you add a bag of crisps to the meal.&amp;#8217;

My 9 yr old granddaughter found this one, and I can&amp;#8217;t figure out how to fix it for her. In Settings/Passcode Lock, she turned simple passcode OFF. When you do that, a text box appears for you to put your passcode in. That field allows you to paste from something you copied. She had made up a password of Emoji characters and pasted it into the field. IOS accepted it. But you don&amp;#8217;t have access to Emoji characters when typing in password characters on your lock screen. Apple protected the user from using Emoji characters by disabling them on the keyboard that pops up when you enter your complex passcode. But since it allows a paste of any character, the Emoji characters were accepted. When she powered the iPod Touch down, the lock screen came up, with no way to enter the Emoji characters. Now the device is permanently locked. When she hooked it up to the computer with iTunes, iTunes couldn&amp;#8217;t recognize it ...it said the device was locked. So she can&amp;#8217;t even restore it to the factory settings. I told her to call Apple or take it to the local Apple store.
