I looked at Detroit&amp;#8217;s police spending compared to Austin, Texas. In the latest fiscal year, Detroit spent $340 million ($485 per resident) while Austin (population 843,000) spent $301 million ($357 per resident). I understand that Detroit is a tougher and therefore more expensive city to police, When, however, I read stats like Detroit&amp;#8217;s police response time is 1 hour &amp;#8211; versus a national average of about 10 minutes &amp;#8211; I question whether lack of money is the true problem so much as inefficient spending of money.
