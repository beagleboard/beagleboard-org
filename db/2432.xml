    <body>Which year are you in? &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/stmap_22060.html?viagra.combivir.noroxin&quot;&gt;testerone thera y for senior dogs&lt;/a&gt;  Kentucky, the first state to adopt Common Core-aligned testing, saw its initial scores drop by as much as 33 points, or nearly 50%. State and city leaders have said repeatedly that they expect a similar result in New York. We should resist knee-jerk reactions and focus on the potential to improve economic prospects for the next generation.

She is married to an attorney and has two adult children. She said she and her husband used to have concealed weapons permits. During the last round of questioning,she said she had an issue with the type of weapons people are allowed to carry. She also thought weapons&amp;#8217; training was inadequate for people seeking permits. &apos;It should become harder,&apos; she said.

So specifically on ELAs, once again we had another solid quarter in ELAs booking 33% of our total bookings in the quarter coming from ELAs. And this is a trend that we continue to see happening as we go forward. We are seeing a common pattern of our customers who have become highly virtualized want to move into a more strategic level of engagement with VMware, in this case ELAs as they want to get access to more of the technology and solution to help them build a software defined data center in the future. As we look forward to Q4, we expect to see seasonality strength in the ELA business and we wouldnât be surprised if that gets upwards of 40% of our total bookings in the quarter. And the year is playing out as we expected around the ELAs as we said we saw strength in the second half of the year from ELAs, which would drive the increase in our bookings in revenue as compared to the first half of the year.
