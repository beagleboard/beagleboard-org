At present it&apos;s hard to find a single app that I use that&apos;s incompatible, though a few intensive 3D games seem to have trouble with the new Tegra 4 system-on-a-chip. True, some (like Netflix) have some awkward landscape-only screens, but it&apos;s generally easy enough to work around them. Of course, landscape-only games like Tetris and Temple Run are more or less unplayable without tilting the device 90 degrees, but they&apos;re not really the sort of games SHIELD was intended for anyway.
