The Haqqanis do not recognize the Durand line, maintain a very parlous and often broken relationship with the Pakistani government, provide arms and fighters to the Taliban - and pose no threat to the U.S. homeland whatsoever. Of course it is necessary and worthwhile to have as many people as possible protecting U.S. troops from IEDs. But when US troops leave in a year or so, the Haqqanis will still be there.
