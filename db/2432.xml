I don&apos;t care. I&apos;ve given it a chance. I have watched the first season and a half. I don&apos;t like it. I don&apos;t believe in Walter&apos;s relationship with Jesse (though both individual performances, by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul respectively, are good). And Walt&apos;s bleating wife is so annoying that whenever she appears on screen I start to rip my fingernails out. The idea that they would ever have married each other is ridiculous. She is the most frustrating character on television, apart from her klepto sister. They&apos;re like two aliens from Planet Ghastly, sent to try the patience of earthling viewers.
