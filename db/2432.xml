    <body>Could I have an application form? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/fortishealthcarecom-noida-0a7b.pdf#rome&quot;&gt;fortishealthcare.com jaipur&lt;/a&gt;  If there&amp;#8217;s no deal, the Treasury Department will be unable to issue any new debt on Oct. 18. That means the nation&amp;#8217;s credit card is maxed out and all we&amp;#8217;re left with is the money in our checking account.
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/enzyte-e3-review-92e2.pdf&quot;&gt;enzyte e3&lt;/a&gt;  I&amp;#8217;m very frustrated about campaign finance rules. Very frustrated by them. I&amp;#8217;ve been telling people for a long time, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know how to solve this problem,&amp;#8217; especially with the Supreme Court moving in a direction I&amp;#8217;m not in favor of. They&amp;#8217;re creating more and more access for large money givers to do what I subvert the system. The solution that was just given recently by a friend of mine said, &amp;#8220;You talk about this Cory. The solution to that is people getting involved.&amp;#8217; You have a woman like the now senator of the great state of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, who was facing that. Facing super PACs, facing these individual donors and what stopped that was hundreds of thousands of Americans giving small donations, a dollar online giving her a chance to fight back and overcome that. &amp;#8220;Wow. Wait a minute. I, a dollar giver in Alaska, can help counteract the forces working against our democracy?&amp;#8217; That&amp;#8217;s power. By the way, another call I made as I drove in here was to my oldest friend from fourth grade who, now knowing that I&amp;#8217;m looking potentially to run for Senate, was bragging to me that he&amp;#8217;s calling all my high school friends and they&amp;#8217;re giving $5 and $20 and $100 and he was so excited about it because he really feels like he&amp;#8217;s participating. He doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be a super PAC guy. He can help me. Lo and behold, in our first financial filing our average donor was really, really small. I was one of the lead senators, I think I saw an article today me and Al Franken were two of the biggest fundraisers in this cycle, had so much of that push from small donors. That&amp;#8217;s a democratising of our democracy and we need to do more of that.
