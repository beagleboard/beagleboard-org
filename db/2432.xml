All of the workers at the plant were accounted for early Tuesday after officials initially could not account for more than a dozen employees. John Herrell of the Lake County Sheriff&apos;s Office said there were no fatalities despite massive blasts that ripped through the Blue Rhino propane plant late Monday night.

I said, âAll right, well, head on back.â â

Not to mention that fact that getting internships anywhere is very tricky, and often students find themselves in unpaid positions. This year has served as a kind of placement, where I have supported myself economically, and afterwards I will be able to say that I spent two semesters working in one of the most elite universities in Colombia. Thatâs certainly something worth sticking on the old CV.
