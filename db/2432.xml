The serial killer wants to draw attention to the disparities between Mexico and the U.S., but unlike in the Scandinavian version of the show, that such disparities exist is not some big, overlooked secret. Ruiz has to get special permission from his boss, an official with serious underworld ties, to seriously investigate the case. Looking to ID half of the body, Ruiz explains that there are hundreds of unidentified dead bodies and body parts in Ciudad Juarez. (Roberto Bolanoâs â2666â would make for a good supporting text).
