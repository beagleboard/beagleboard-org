All three were killed on January 27, 1967 by a fire during what was supposed to have been a routine ground test of the Block 1 Apollo command and service module. In order to simulate the vehicle&apos;s pressure while in vacuum, the cabin was pressurized with 16.7 PSI of pure oxygen. A tiny spark from frayed wiring rapidly transformed the capsule&apos;s interior into an inferno. The crew were asphyxiated and quickly died; the resulting investigation uncovered mismanagement and issues at many different levels of NASA. Somewhat presciently, Gus Grissom had commented on exactly this kind of situation before his death: &quot;If we die,&quot; he wrote, &quot;we want people to accept it. We are in a risky business, and we hope that if anything happens to us, it will not delay the program. The conquest of space is worth the risk of life.&quot;
