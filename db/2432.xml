    <body>Have you got any qualifications? &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/shop-apothekecom-erfahrung-213a.pdf#mumble&quot;&gt;shop-apotheke.com account lschen&lt;/a&gt;  A movement to let us export as much of our natural gas as we can. Now what I&apos;m afraid of is that that&apos;s going to raise prices to the oil-ranked level. Everyone says that the only way to let gas prices settle is to use free market methods and let people export as much as they want and let the free market decide what the price should be. That sounds very good, but it misses the point that oil is not a free market. Oil prices are set by the OPEC cartel. If it weren&apos;t for the cartel, oil prices would probably be cheaper than natural gas. So we shouldn&apos;t be letting natural gas rise to the cartel-set oil price; we should be letting natural gas stay at its real market price, which is what people are willing to pay right now and what it costs people to produce it at an average profit. And, if we have that, that will really reinforce this whole manufacturing boom. And we&apos;ll get a lot more jobs out of the manufacturing boom than we will get from exporting all of our natural gas, or even half of it.
