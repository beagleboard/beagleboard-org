    <body>Wonderfull great site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/six-star-fit-figure-pills-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;six star fit figure&lt;/a&gt;  These questions got me thinking. Which party, MLB, the MLBPA, or the players themselves would benefit most or at all from such information becoming public? First, let&apos;s consider the option that someone familiar with the details of the investigation leaked the information secretly, doing so because he/she felt the public deserved to know, or to demonstrate to a reporter that he/she knew something they didn&apos;t. This option remains a possibility, but Thurm even leaves it out as one because baseball isn&apos;t exactly known for whistle blowers or leaks. Basically, if the information got out there, it&apos;s probably because someone involved in the situation wanted it so for some gain.
