He drove an hour to see Wednesday&apos;s showdown.

The chart above shows that mortgage applications and housing sales have diverged from their usual relationship because over 60% of new house purchases are cash deals by speculators, not consumers. How soon the mainstream media forgets that a housing market inflated by speculative activity is a bubble Ã  la 2006.
