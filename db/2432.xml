    <body>Accountant supermarket manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/stmap_a6a40.html?cialis.forte.zestoretic&quot;&gt;buy digestinol&lt;/a&gt;  The threat to our green spaces has never been greater. Of course we need housing and jobs, but we also need a sympathetic and understanding approach to their provision &amp;ndash; not wholesale concreting over of the landscape in the name of progress. Houses need to be built where infrastructure has been thought through &amp;ndash; access, transport, the provision services, health care and education are seldom a part of this unjoined-up thinking. More often than not such developments are a result of no more than a &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s a field, let&amp;rsquo;s fill it with houses&amp;rdquo; policy. The result is bound to end in tears &amp;ndash; for those who move in and find themselves woefully lacking in facilities, and for those whose locale has been blighted by double the number of cars and people calling on local amenities.
