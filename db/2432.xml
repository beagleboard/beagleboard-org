 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/opioidscomoffshorepharmacy-ab8a.pdf&quot;&gt;opioids.com&lt;/a&gt;  I provide independent research of technology companies including mobile and SaaS Enterprise Applications. I was a buy-side technology analyst at Atlantic Trust (Invesco&apos;s high net worth group) for seven years and one of two analysts that determined the technology holdings for a firm with $15 billion under management. My primary focus was hardware, software, services and Internet companies. Before joining Atlantic Trust I was the Internet Security Software analyst for Smith Barney. I authored the most comprehensive industry report âInternet Security Software: The Ultimate Internet Infrastructureâ and an innovative analysis of deferred revenue âBreaking the Code on Deferred Revenueâ. My first entree to the financial community was at Salomon Brothers following the Enterprise Server Hardware companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. Prior to becoming an equity analyst I spent sixteen years at IBM in a variety of sales and manufacturing positions. I have a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Stanford University and a Postgraduate Diploma in Economics from the University of Sussex, England. My email address is chuck@sandhillinsights.com
