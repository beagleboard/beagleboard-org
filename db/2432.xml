The former SS captain was convicted of war crimes in 1998 for his part in the killings of 335 Italians â including at least 70 Jews â in 1944. He had been held under house arrest in Rome for the last 15 years and after he died Friday churches in the city refused to host his funeral. Government officials in Rome also refused to hold his funeral as did Priebkeâs adopted home of Argentina and the town of his birth, Henninsdorf, in Germany.
