    <body>magic story very thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?viagra.tolterodine.tamsulosin&quot;&gt;galantamine cvs&lt;/a&gt;  The problem they face while they are online is still one of trust however. The best known travel website, TripAdvisor, for example, is predicated on the idea that you can bypass tour operators and agents altogether to get reliable advice from real people posting reviews of where they stay. But how trustworthy is it? TripAdvisor has always grappled with two key issues. Firstly, users of the site can never be sure of the motives of those who post reviews, and whether or not they share their tastes and preferences. Secondly, as Telegraph Travel has reported may times, TripAdvisor can&amp;rsquo;t always protect itself from fake reviews written, or commissioned by, the owner of the property concerned - or indeed by a rival down the road.
