If we weren&amp;#8217;t warmongering around the world, throwing billions in useless foreign aid around and wasting countless dollars on pork programs we would actually be running a budget surplus in this country and be able to start paying off our debt&amp;#8217;s. Simple economics but it is these criminal globalist bankers that want to complete the greatest theft in the history of mankind by getting the US to spend itself into oblivion. They are your enemies Americans! Don&amp;#8217;t let anyone tell you the debt ceiling must be raised because they are lying to you and robbing you and your children blind!
