You do have control over who you date and who you choose to be with, which in turn is usually who you fall in love with. Making smarter choices about who you choose to spend your time with can lead to better choices in a long-term partner and a more fulfilling and satisfying relationship. Itâs possible to really enjoy someoneâs company or personality, but that doesnât necessarily make them a good fit for a lifetime lover.

Lane was played by none other than Teri Hatcher of &apos;Desperate Housewives&apos; fame. Following &apos;Lois and Clarke&apos;, Hatcher&apos;s career had some high points, as bond girl Paris Carver in &apos;Tomorrow Never Dies&apos; as one example. By the early 2000&apos;s, however, Hatcher&apos;s career had seriously waned until a lead in drama-comedy series, &apos;Desperate Housewives&apos; put her back on top of the TV stack once again.
