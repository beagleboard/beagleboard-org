Francesa even asked A-Rod if âhe trusts the Yankees.â Last week A-Rod called in and was rewarded with a Pope Twinkie Munch.

The magnetite had to be cooled to minus 190 degrees Celsius to lock in its electrical charge. That means that scientists need to find out a way to warm things up to room temperature. Currently, the researchers plan to identify exotic compounds and test new techniques to induce the twitching and tap into other properties that are superior to modern-day silicon transistors. They&apos;ve already conducted follow-up studies that focus on a hybrid material that exhibits similar ultrafast switching properties at near room temperatures; this could make it a prime candidate for commercial use.

They are not in danger of disappearing under the time limits required for listing in the Endangered Species Act, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
