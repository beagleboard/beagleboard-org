    <body>I&apos;d like to transfer some money to this account &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/htmpharmacycom-69bc.pdf&quot;&gt;angelhealth.pt.aliexpress.com&lt;/a&gt;  John Jett, a former trainer, told me how, like me, he fell in love with cetaceans as a boy. After acquiring a science degree, he applied for a job at SeaWorld, where he became an apprentice trainer. &amp;ldquo;You learnt on the job,&amp;rdquo; he says. But Jett was soon disabused of his idealism. He claims SeaWorld was more concerned with training its staff in how to respond to &amp;ldquo;sceptical guests&amp;rdquo; than in encouraging scientific research. &amp;ldquo;You got media training on how to deflect awkward questions &amp;ndash; told how to put a positive spin on things,&amp;rdquo; he says. He felt intimidated and was convinced that if he complained he&amp;rsquo;d be punished by being moved to work with the sea lions. SeaWorld says this is simply not true.
