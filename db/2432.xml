Since the fall of Saddam Hussein&apos;s regime in 2003, Iran has pursued a consistent strategy toward Iraq: to create a pro-Iranian satellite dependent on Tehran&apos;s guidance and largesse. It has done so through a massive campaign of overt and covert influence, one that has included the bankrolling of Shi&apos;ite militias, support for assorted Iraqi politicians and the insertion of intelligence and paramilitary assets on the territory of its western neighbor. But in recent years, Tehran&apos;s efforts have been hindered &amp;ndash; at least in part &amp;ndash; by the presence of American and allied troops, the Sunni &quot;awakening,&quot; and the Iraqi political system itself, which has tried to emphasize nationalism over religious identification.

One MP said the international community was more aware of security threats in Nairobi than the national authorities. Others complained of corruption and incompetence among the police and immigration authorities.
