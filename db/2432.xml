Those were optimistic days in Stillwater under coach Jimmy Johnson in 1983. Weeks impressed early; coaches told him to become a third-down receiver after he sat out a year, but he wanted to play immediately. After one semester at State, the Ryans returned to Southwestern and Weeks followed his old offensive coordinator, Woody Roof, to Northwest Oklahoma. Weeks gained more experience and strength there, but suffered his greatest loss, as well. At 22, Weeks lost his father, asphyxiated in a fire while asleep in his home.
