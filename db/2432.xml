You could go into almost any public building without even so much as a metal detector screening you first. The district also banned handguns, which, it&apos;s true, did not stop gun violence. Since D.C. is bordered by two states, including one (Virginia) where gun laws are quite lax, it wasn&apos;t too difficult to acquire a firearm and bring it over the city line. But since the Supreme Court decided the sweeping gun ban was unconstitutional, there&apos;s more of a free-for-all attitude with guns. What galls Washingtonians more is that it wasn&apos;t locals who wanted the gun ban lifted. It was people who don&apos;t even live here.
