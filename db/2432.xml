In 1960, the country&amp;#8217;s biggest employer, General Motors, was also its most profitable company and one of its best-paying. It had high profit margins and real pricing power, even as it was paying its workers union wages. And it was not alone: firms like Ford, Standard Oil, and Bethlehem Steel employed huge numbers of well-paid workers while earning big profits. Today, the country&amp;#8217;s biggest employers are retailers and fast-food chains, almost all of which have built their businesses on low pay&amp;#8212;they&amp;#8217;ve striven to keep wages down and unions out&amp;#8212;and low prices.
