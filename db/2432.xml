While the Leap&amp;#8217;s cameras seem to only use infrared light (provided by three infrared LEDs inside the unit), the Haptix can use ambient light and infrared. Ambient light enables the capturing of much more detail, which is a boon for accuracy, but it requires &amp;#8220;a few tricks&amp;#8221; for the computer vision algorithm to handle that much data in real time. Lim stopped short of explaining what their secret sauce actually is (it&amp;#8217;s being patented at the moment), but it is this new algorithm that can handle ambient light that makes the Haptix more accurate and flexible than the Leap. According to Lim, the Leap cannot be used in the same manner as the Haptix.
