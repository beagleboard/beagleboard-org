Nowadays you can go online via your TV. Your child will use all sorts of devices and gadgets; make sure you&amp;#8217;re aware of which ones can connect to the internet, such as their phone or games console. Also, find out how they are accessing the internet &amp;#8211; is it your connection or a neighbour&amp;#8217;s wifi? This will affect whether your safety settings are being applied.
