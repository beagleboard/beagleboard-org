The exciting people are the ones with the drugs and the guns. In addition, I&amp;#8217;m a little disturbed that I now know so much about cooking meth. (That&amp;#8217;s the lingo, see. You don&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;manufacture&amp;#8221; meth. You &amp;#8220;cook&amp;#8221; it. Like brownies, only instead of flour and sugar and cocoa, you use pseudoephedrine. This is something I know now. Thanks, &amp;#8220;Breaking Bad&amp;#8221;!)

It is not doing me no good, being in there. In a shelter you get what they call situational depression, but if you remove the person from the situation sometimes the depression goes away. These other guys you see on the corner are like me, hoping to meet someone who can help us. Sometimes contractors or movers come by with day jobs. Families visit and bring food.
