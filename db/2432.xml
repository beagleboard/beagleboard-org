Tennis has brought her great wealth, particularly since Max Eisenbud, who helped to turn Maria Sharapova into the world&apos;s highest-earning sportswoman, became her agent. Since Eisenbud started signing up a host of sponsors keen to exploit the Chinese market, Li has jumped to second in the annual list of highest earners in women&apos;s sport compiled by Forbes magazine. Li earned $18m (Â£11.4m) in the year to April 2012, an increase of $10m on the previous year and $5m more than Serena Williams.
