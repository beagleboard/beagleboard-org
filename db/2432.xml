As I was leaving the Reuters building later that night I coincidentally bumped into Robert Burck getting into a cab with his wife Patricia Cruz. âCome along with us, jump in the front seat, we are going to a private boat cruise party.&amp;#8221; I guess my interesting day wasn&amp;#8217;t done yet. For two hours we cruised past the Statue of Liberty and then up the East River with Burck using the same arsenal of songs, comments, and dance moves to entertain the guests. He took some time off from doing his act to chow down on some BBQ and even dance with his wife. It seemed Burck just keeps going, 365 days a year, no matter where he is.
