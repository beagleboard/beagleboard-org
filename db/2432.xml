But the global recession, combined with the huge &amp;ldquo;youth bulge&amp;rdquo; that has left half of the Arab world&amp;rsquo;s population under 25, prevented the state from meeting its side of the bargain. An entire generation of young men, many of them college-educated, was growing up with little chance of a job, and therefore little chance of ever being marriage material in what is still a conservative society.
