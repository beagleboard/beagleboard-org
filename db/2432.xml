    <body>Through friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/stmap_79a80.html?tromethamine.irbesartan.linezolid.cialis&quot;&gt;andy pharmacy 10032&lt;/a&gt;  Shaw doesn&apos;t believe the Spanish government even want the Rock. &quot;What would they do with it? There are 30,000 of us here. We&apos;d be a ghost town in 30 days if the Spanish took over. All the commerce would disappear overnight.&quot; He reckons the Spanish wouldn&apos;t be allowed to keep it offshore because the EU would deem Gib to be an integral part of Spain rather than an overseas dependency with its own rules. The Rock may be an anachronism, but that&apos;s the only basis on which it can function. &quot;We&apos;d be of no use to the Spanish,&quot; he says. &quot;We can&apos;t grow anything here. We don&apos;t produce anything here.&quot; They don&apos;t even fish any more, despite being surrounded by the sea, which is why the Spaniards were able to fish in their waters undisturbed for so long. Without offshore commerce, they would be nothing: a Rock without a role.
