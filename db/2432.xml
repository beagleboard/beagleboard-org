    <body>Hold the line, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/derma-viva-skin-7684.pdf#physical&quot;&gt;derma viva&lt;/a&gt;  This idea of &apos;femininity&apos; versus &apos;masculinity&apos; dates back decades. Boys were told to be emotionless, opinionated and strong while girls were told to be nice, good and to make sure they were &apos;seen and not heard&apos;.

Rather, the reasons were idiosyncratic, representing some constellation of privilege and serendipity. The more affluent aboard the Titanic were on higher decks and had more time to await rescue before the rising waters overtook them. Some were perhaps fit and strong and better able to withstand elements of the evolving calamity. Some were maybe just lucky â in the right part of the ship at the right time.
