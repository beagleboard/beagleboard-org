    <body>I&apos;d like to tell you about a change of address &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/pharmaciebougiebaorg-a6a4.pdf&quot;&gt;genericwpthemes.com&lt;/a&gt;  Based on ABC&apos;s &quot;The Lookout&apos;s&quot; findings, Antoinette Matlins says her final tip to consumers is to remember to ask explicitly: &quot;Has the diamond been treated or enhanced in any way?&quot; If the seller says, &quot;yes,&quot; then the buyer must find out whether the enhancement is permanent or not. Even if the seller&apos;s response is &quot;no,&quot; it is important for consumers still to get the seller&apos;s response in writing on their sales receipt to the effect of, &quot;this diamond has not been treated or enhanced in any way.&quot; Today, with new technologies, there are many things that can be done to change the appearance of the diamond from what nature created to something that actually would be considered an improvement on nature. According to Matlins, these treatments may not be problematic if consumers take proper precautions and often provide value for people who want to get &quot;more bang for their buck.&quot; The only issue is when sellers don&apos;t disclose the treatment to consumers, making it difficult to evaluate the value of the deal and potential damage to the stone during high heat repairs. An unknowing buyer may not know that the glass filler often used in clarity enhancement may not withstand the high heat sometimes used in jewelry repairs and enhanced stones may need to be removed before such repairs are performed. She says sellers should provide consumers with all the options based on their budget, including enhanced stones and unenhanced stones, so they can make an informed decision of their own.
