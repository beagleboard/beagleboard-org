Season with ground black pepper, and strew over them plenty of chopped fresh herbs, tarragon, chives, basil, parsley, whatever is available, and a little garlic. Just before serving sprinkle with salt and olive oil. Made in this way a tomato salad is fresh and crisp and aromatic; it is the dressing of tomatoes several hours before they are to be served that makes them watery and clammy, although it has to be admitted that all the precautions in the world can do little to make commercially grown English and Channel Island tomatoes anything but mushy and tasteless.&amp;rdquo; All the more reason to grow our own.
