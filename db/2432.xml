He quickly built a 4-1 lead and finished the set without dropping a point on his first serve (17-for-17). From there, he improved off the ground and the winners flowed more freely. He broke Brands early in the third set and added one more to race away to victory at the ATP 500 clay-court tournament, which Federer added to his schedule after a second-round loss at Wimbledon.
