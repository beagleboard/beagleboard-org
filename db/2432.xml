He stressed that dealer location was not a factor when it comes to allocating new vehicles and providing marketing support, but he said South China would be a better testing ground to try out new marketing programs such as maker-certified used cars and vehicle-leasing.

Another component of their growth was the development of new digital products. This quarter, the Sports Group launched a major new digital product, For The Win, built as a mobile first, social sharing-focused product. The launch of what we call FTW was sponsored exclusively and subsequently renewed at a significant CPM and effective annual run rate. Engagement is measured by unique visitors, and page views has widely exceeded internal plans thus far. We are also pleased that since our acquisition of Big League Sports last year and the roll up of all Gannett&apos;s sport assets into the Sports Group, we have maintained a top 5 audience position as measured by comScore as we continue to increase digital audience and scale and revenue opportunities.

Last year&apos;s net earnings included after-tax special items of about $0.6 billion.

Dickey last winter â close by in Las Vegas, not thousands of miles away in Binghamton, in case he is called up to replace Buck.
