While this report highlights the gains we are making, we still can do much more to reduce teen driver crash-related injuries and deaths,â says Chris Mullen, director of Technology Research, Strategic Resources at State Farm. âPromising strategies include programs that encourage parents to enforce GDL provisions limiting the number of friends their newly licensed teens may drive, as well as those that support safe passenger behavior and increased parental involvement in the learning to drive process.â
