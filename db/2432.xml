We have moved to the corporate controlled corrupt government stage and most of the sheep in this country are going along willingly since they are so well educated to follow. When the next market correction comes the moron followers will once again be screaming &amp;#8220;why didn&amp;#8217;t the government do something&amp;#8221;, even though most are now screaming &amp;#8220;get government out of my life&amp;#8221;. Listen one more time, the corporations control the government, they preapprove and select our candidates. Their is no politician who would take a stand not preapproved by the wealthiest companies. You all are in a false democracy, and primarily because you are brainwashed to believe that your owners are good Christians.

When the president promised that a &quot;tech surge&quot; of &quot;some of the best IT talent in the country&quot; is fixing the website, Stewart pounced again: &quot;A surge?&quot; he cried. &quot;Your website is so f--ked up we have to use the same strategy we used to salvage the Iraq war?&quot;
