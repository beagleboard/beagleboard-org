Tampa went for it on fourth down twice in the first half and came up empty on both occasions, but reinforced the idea that if you want to beat New England, you have to play outside your comfort zone a bit and not be cowed by the Patriots. However, those misses on fourth down would have been a little more palatable if Tampa was able to convert on a 38-yard field goal attempt with just over 10 minutes left in the first quarter. In a game that figures to be close in the second half, it&amp;#8217;s a miss that could come back to haunt them.
