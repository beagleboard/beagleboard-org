    <body>Will I be paid weekly or monthly? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/generic-irbesartan-uk-7684.pdf#rival&quot;&gt;generic irbesartan uk&lt;/a&gt;  Chances of a carbon tax passing through the present Congress are about as good as a snowball&amp;rsquo;s in the warming Arctic. (Show me a politician who is willing to utter both the &quot;C&quot; word and the &quot;T&quot; word in the same sentence, and I will show you someone whose political career is nearing its end &amp;mdash; or already over. Witness Inglis, who was ousted by a Tea Partier in the Republican primaries in 2010.) However, given the rising urgency of global warming, a carbon tax could certainly be considered, what with its free-market appeal.
