Itâs unfortunate that the mayor is resorting to ad hominem attacks.â

Teams from around the world, from all walks of life, compete in our competitions,&quot; said Dr. Peter H.

Whether it&apos;s overfishing, pollution, plastics, or the myriad of other challenges, hearing directly from concerned and motivated individuals will yield new and unexpected solutions.&quot;

Teams have no reason to respect it and they can more readily defend the deep ball that has been the Giantsâ trademark. Basically, the Giants have lost their identity as an offense. Eli needs to get into a rhythm and he canât. Lance Briggs has been a monster for the Bears at weakside linebacker, and I donât see the Giants getting much done on the ground again. Marc Trestman has Jay Cutler playing with more awareness. Heâs had just one poor game against the Lions but otherwise has been pretty decisive. The Bears have struggled at times with blitz pickup. Perry Fewell isnât a big blitz guy. He may have to be.â
