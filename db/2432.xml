    <body>My battery&apos;s about to run out &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/piracetam-800-mg-kaina-3c56.pdf#involuntary&quot;&gt;recepta na piracetam&lt;/a&gt;  Unlike the protests against GM crops, these groups are not enthusiastically backed by big organisations like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. They rely on private donations and are less tightly-knit than earlier protest groups. Their tactics owe more to Occupy London or to anti-austerity groups such as UK Uncut. They are quick at setting up camp sites equipped with kitchens and libraries. It is less certain how effective these groups are at sustaining a protest, particularly one which may require trekking to rural parts of the country to gain support. (Balcombe, less than an hour away from London, is unusually convenient.) With a high turnover of young protesters they can burn out easily, suggests Christopher Rootes of the University of Kent, another green-watcher.
