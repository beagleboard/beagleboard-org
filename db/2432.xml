With Chernoble, many russians died or were seriously contaminated when they took care of their problem. The Japanese do not appear ready to use this meathod. A new constuction design is often not usable in an existing facility without removing the facility. If there is ten times the nuclear fuel than that is a hundred times more complicated problem. I do not think the Japanese has got serious yet about fixing their problem, when they do get serious, they will fix it, they are a smart and brave people. But they tend to apologize for mistakes instead of fixing them theirselves. But the blame game is common for all countries so they are not that much different. My guess their upgrading the seriousness of the problem is a political move, so they can claim emminent domain and have the government fix the problem instead of private enterprise.
