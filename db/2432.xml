    <body>Where&apos;s the nearest cash machine? &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/goqii-arena-price-2206.pdf&quot;&gt;goqii arena&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8220;In this shelter they treat you like an inmate,&amp;#8221; Springs said. &amp;#8220;I stay in it only in inclement weather. It is not doing me no good, being in there. In a shelter you get what they call situational depression, but if you remove the person from the situation sometimes the depression goes away. These other guys you see on the corner are like me, hoping to meet someone who can help us. Sometimes contractors or movers come by with day jobs. Families visit and bring food. But the D.H.S.&amp;#8212;man, they have forgot us. The last person from this corner that got housed was like two years ago.&amp;#8221;
