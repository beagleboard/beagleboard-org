    <body>I&apos;d like to take the job &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?cyclogyl.gasex-sr.cialis.clozaril&quot;&gt;virekta plus&lt;/a&gt;  All this has happened in joyous defiance of the accepted way of launching an arts festival, which always involves thickets of bureaucracy. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to rely on intuition and inspiration, as this one has. There has to be a feasibility study, followed up by a business plan, two things surely tailor-made to stifle the breath of Apollo. Without these, the institutions that exist to help the arts will hesitate. They&amp;rsquo;ll listen politely to your enthusiastic spiel, and they may even be sympathetic. But that may not be enough to make them open their cheque-books. They&amp;rsquo;ll have their own agenda, their boxes that have to be ticked. You need to show you&amp;rsquo;re appealing to more than just people who share your odd tastes. You need to show you&amp;rsquo;ve got your sums right, and that the venue has the right number of fire exits, and the right insurance, and is easily accessible to every social and ethnic group.
