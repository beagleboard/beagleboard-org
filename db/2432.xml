During the first take, the force of Daphne hitting the table blew the charge out, so the fire was manually lit by one of the pyro guys with a torch, so the timing of the fire was a bit late. During the second take, the fire lit on time, but I cued Jimmy too early, so the fire wasn&apos;t as dramatic as I would have liked, so I decided to do a third take. However, when I squatted down to reset the shot, I heard a crunch in back of me--I knew immediately that I had just broken our third and last table. Lucky, when I turned around, I had just broken off the corner of the table. Still, I felt like a real idiot. Fortunately, we were able to frame out most the damage. If you look at the far left bottom corner of the video, you can see the broken edge of the table. The third take went well and it was the one we used.

He was stealing second on the first pitch to Shane Victorino by the Raysâ Joel Peralta when it went for a wild pitch that let Xander Bogaerts score from third. Ellsbury let up only a moment before cruising into third base easily. He scored the go-ahead run on Victorinoâs infield single.
