    <body>How long are you planning to stay here? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?sparfloxacin.pepcid.starlix.viagra&quot;&gt;medicor global jobs&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;Bachelorette&quot; lovebirds Ashley Hebert and J.P. Rosenbaum tied the knot in a California ceremony on Dec. 1, 2012 that was filmed for an ABC special, &quot;The Bachelorette: Ashley and J.P.&apos;s Wedding&quot;. The duo became engaged on the Season 7 finale of &quot;Bachelorette&quot; during the final-rose ceremony in Fiji during summer 2011. The ceremony was at the lovely Langham Huntington in Pasadena, Calif., which is close to downtown Los Angeles, where many of the couple&apos;s nearly 300 guests stayed. The couple had a garden wedding with a reception in one of the hotel&apos;s ballrooms and exchanged Neil Lane rings during the ceremony. The made-in-reality TV twosome, one of only three couples from the extended &quot;Bachelor&quot; and &quot;Bachelorette&quot; franchise to stay together, picked the upbeat tune &quot;Love,&quot; by Matt White, as their official wedding song. ABC reportedly paid them $250,000 for the special.
