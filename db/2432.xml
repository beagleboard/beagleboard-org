The authors of the study explain: &quot;Just as people enjoy rooting for their favorite sports team and arguing that their team&apos;s players are superior, even when they are not, surveys give citizens an opportunity to cheer for their partisan team &amp;hellip; Deep down, however, individuals understand the true merits of different teams and players &amp;ndash; or, at the minimum, they understand that they don&apos;t know enough to support their expressive responding as correct.&quot;
