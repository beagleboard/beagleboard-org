Skeptics protested that the star was trying to pull off an elaborate hoax and even Paltrow called her co-star&apos;s behavior &apos;odd,&apos; but Phoenix&apos;s rep repeatedly defended the career switch. Though he never admitted the bizarre behavior was fake, in January of 2010 a clean-cut Phoenix spoofed his spacey appearance on Letterman in a video for a charity campaign.
