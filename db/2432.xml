Say what? Hereâs the bottom line: This is the 28th straight year the Royals havenât made the postseason â seventh straight under Mooreâs watch â and over the winter Moore did an excellent job in addressing their biggest weakness, starting pitching, with his trade acquisitions of James Shields and Wade Davis from the Rays and Ervin Santana from the Angels, and the signing of 15-game winner Jeremy Guthrie. The Royals led the American League in pitching and had one of the top closers in baseball in Greg Holland (47 saves, 1.21 ERA). Trading their top prospect, Wil Myers, for Shields and Davis, was an admitted risk (especially if Shields walks as a free agent after next year) but Moore felt he had to do it in order to make this the year the Royals finally made it back to the postseason. Yet, with the wild card still in reach, they went 3-3 against two of the worst teams in baseball, the White Sox and Mariners, over the last six games. And now, given the uncertain Shields situation, their window of opportunity could be shrinking and theyâre going to need a big bat like Myersâ in the years to come.

At stake is the possible bounty from previously-untapped reserves of oil and gas.

He is effectively the incumbent in this dynamic, with the presumption that if he can be held under 50, it&apos;ll mean he&apos;s got problems, and that the bulk of the undecideds will break for the other guy.
