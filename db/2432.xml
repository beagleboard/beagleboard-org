It is no doubt a blow, as Hong Kong is where large Chinese firms have listed since they were permitted to sell shares overseas.

The first will largely concentrate on marshalling memories and stories to provide a personal account for your immediate family, while the latter will go back beyond living memory and involve making the best of your researches; but both approaches rely on creating a narrative. Using internet tools, it is now comparatively easy to construct a family tree, but this is not the same thing as a family history. We can consult all the census returns, parish records, registrations of births, marriages and deaths we like, but names, dates and places do not make a story &amp;ndash; and it is family stories we crave. Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s history plays are at one level the family story of the Plantagenets; Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s novels are concerned with property, marriages and vile relatives; many of Dickens&amp;rsquo;s plots hinge on family connections; popular television dramas from Downton Abbey to EastEnders are family sagas.
