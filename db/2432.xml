    <body>We need someone with experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/vernon-blvd-pharmacy-inc-long-island-city-ny-6a83.pdf#angle&quot;&gt;vernon blvd pharmacy inc&lt;/a&gt;  King points out that in 2009, the awards ceremony was held in Glasgow for the first time, having moved from its home of London. (Interestingly, King says the move wasn&apos;t about saving money &amp;ndash; &quot;the costs are higher&quot; &amp;ndash; but about celebrating diversity and making it less London-centric). But her point is that the audience in Glasgow for the live show is &quot;predominantly white&quot; &amp;ndash; suggesting it&apos;s a show enjoyed by white people as much as Black or Asian fans.
