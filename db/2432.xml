Instead of taking up arms, this previously violent group sought to implement its agenda by taking part in the process, and had their leader, Morsi elected. Now that the Egyptian military has removed him (and kept him in an undisclosed location) and arrested many members of his organization, the resort to the democratic process may seem futile to many who espouse jihadism. This removal will likely cause jihadists in the region to look at the current situation and find resort to democracy useless and a dead end. I expect jihadists to use this situation to show that elections and engaging in the political process only leads to disaster. The other alternative? Violence and terrorism.
