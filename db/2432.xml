It&apos;s often said that Australians don&apos;t vote for conservative governments but against Labor ones, and the destabilising, internecine Labor warfare had dominated the news since Rudd&apos;s deposition in 2010.

Addressing this deficit might not prevent further conflict, but not doing so will certainly make hostilities more probable.

Hewitt got broken when he served for the first set at 5-4, and again when he served for the fourth at 5-3.
