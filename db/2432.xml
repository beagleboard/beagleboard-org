    <body>I live here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/family-eye-medical-group-hours-ab8a.pdf&quot;&gt;family eye medical group long beach robert clark&lt;/a&gt;  After his comments were published, Calderoli said, &amp;#8220;If I&amp;#8217;ve offended her, I apologize.&amp;#8221;Â &amp;#8221;It was a joke, a comment in a joking way. There was nothing particularly against her,&amp;#8221; he added. &amp;#8220;It was just my impression. It is all very well that she be a minister but in her own country. Given that this government needs to govern Italy, I hope that it is done by Italians.&amp;#8221;
