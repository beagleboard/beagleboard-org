Whatever it may be, it has an impact. On top of that, adults have extreme discomfort with cross-identified children. It&apos;s a toxic brew for creating confusion for children.

The most obvious losses are those associated with recovering lost or destroyed data, notification, obligations, monitoring, forensic investigation expenses, and business interruption expenses. A 2012 Law and the Boardroom study found the average organizational loss from a data breach now exceeds $5.5 million, with U.S. businesses spending, on average, $8.9 million annually on cybercrime. Global cybercrime will cost companies approximately $300 billion to $1 trillion, in 2013 alone. For example, after a major credit card payment processing company suffered a cyber breach in 2009, the company and its officers and directors were forced to pay over $100 million in settlements to various business partners. Reputations, especially for large companies who are keen to preserve their names within an industry, can be hit hard or permanently damaged.

Instead, it licenses its processors as essentially a kitâintellectual property that can be used as is, or surrounded with a chip designerâs own peripheral logic. Thatâs forced Intelâs hand, Moorhead said. âSo theyâre going to have to be custom, and more flexible, to keep their 95 percent market share,â Moorhead said of Intel.

In 2003, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators slammed 10 investment banks with $1.4 billion in fines.
