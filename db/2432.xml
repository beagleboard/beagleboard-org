    <body>I&apos;m originally from Dublin but now live in Edinburgh &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/alli-yahoo-answers-3c56.pdf&quot;&gt;alli yahoo&lt;/a&gt;  Must be nice to be gay and service connected and get benefits for spouse. I am Desert Storm Navy veterans with vulnerability to chemical weapons and vaccines which I can prove. Have Gulf War Illness want desperately for jury trial to prove my disability. The government laughs at me saying veterans don&apos;t rate a jury to decide their cases. I was exposed to chemical leak on my ship which could duplicate chemical weapons which I am vulnerable to. denied for that. My blood enzyme condition has had fatal reactions to anthrax vaccine as well as life altering denied for that. Head injury during Navy service non combat related on base non service connected for that. Constant rashes, pain from exertion, stomach problems, memory issues, deformed body limbs after injury, vertigo, sleep problems including sleep apnea all denied. As I SAID must be nice to get service connection when other veterans have over whelming evidence and are denied condition because of political propaganda about who got sick in Desert Storm and where.
