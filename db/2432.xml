Monthly job growth â including the private sector and federal, state and local governments â has averaged about 200,000 so far this year, according to the Labor Department. Economic growth, meanwhile, is estimated to be running below a 2% annual rate . The government&apos;s first estimate of second-quarter GDP out Wednesday showed the annual growth pace at 1.7%, but first-quarter GDP was revised down to a 1.1% pace from an earlier estimate of 1.8%.
