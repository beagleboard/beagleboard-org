Monday&apos;s game was the fifth time this season hes struck out 14 or more batters in a game; only three pitchers have ever done it six times or more in one year.

Darvish is rubbing shoulders with strikeout legends like Pedro Martinez, Nolan Ryan, and Randy Johnson. But what&apos;s truly remarkable is that he isn&apos;t alone in his pitching mastery.
