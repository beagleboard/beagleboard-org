The resort total of 4 Valleys, Switzerland, was found to be 198km above Schrahe&apos;s figure &amp;ndash; a discrepancy of 120 per cent. Meanwhile, St Anton, Austria, was one of the report&apos;s saints, being only three per cent out. Schadming, also in Austria, was the only measured resort to say it&apos;s smaller than it actually is &amp;ndash; claiming 121km, and having 131.
