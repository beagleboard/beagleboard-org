    <body>Do you like it here? &lt;a href=&quot;https://newscvm.com/generic-drugs-and-the-fda-e9bb.pdf&quot;&gt;prescription drugs and urine tests&lt;/a&gt;  Another local potato farmer, Frank Green, had to resort to desperate measures. A quarter of his crop was still in the ground in November, explains Patrick Lewis, from Gamber, the agricultural produce company that coordinates the growing operation and logistics for Tyrrells. &amp;ldquo;He had to find Â£380,000, the price of a house, for a self-propelling harvester that could lift potatoes out of the waterlogged soil. If it had been left a week longer the whole crop would have been lost.&amp;rdquo;
