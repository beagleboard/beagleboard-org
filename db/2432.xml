    <body>Could you please repeat that? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/swhey-healix-production-75b3.pdf&quot;&gt;swhey healix production&lt;/a&gt;  Both Miranda and her mother, Lady Victoria Leatham (of Antiques Roadshow fame), know what it is like to be brought up in the 100-plus rooms and 1,300 acres of Burghley &amp;ndash; even if that experience has changed over the years. Lady Victoria remembers arriving at the age of nine in 1956, when her father inherited the estate. The house had no electricity: each night she climbed 67 dark steps to her bedroom with gas lamps hissing at the bottom and top. &amp;ldquo;There were tattered textiles and broken porcelain as far as the eye could see,&amp;rdquo; she says, and a distinctive smell of gas, dust, leather, polish and old dogs. &amp;ldquo;It was magical!&amp;rdquo;
