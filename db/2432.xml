It&amp;#8217;s that feeling of &amp;#8216;Gee, if someone like me is there doing that work,&amp;#8217; then &amp;#8216;I can too.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;

The handling is very stable, while taut suspension, Pirelli tyres and fairly generous ground clearance add to the appeal. The single front disc and Brembo caliper give excellent stopping power. On the motorway there&amp;rsquo;s mild vibrations through the handlebars by about 4,000rpm and 70mph in top. And if you&amp;rsquo;re not in a hurry it&amp;rsquo;s as fun as it&amp;rsquo;s economical.

My point is political. Subjective experiences &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;anecdotes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; have political force, no matter how much &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; is produced in opposition. No survey, no matter how insistent about &amp;ldquo;a year-on-year increase in patient satisfaction&amp;rdquo;, will defuse my suspicion of the NHS, not after watching the nursing in that Essex ward. The recent Keogh report into NHS failures affects the political landscape not for its &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo;, but for the permission it gives to those who don&amp;rsquo;t share Danny Boyle&amp;rsquo;s Olympian faith in the intrinsic goodness of anyone called &amp;ldquo;nurse&amp;rdquo; to say so.
