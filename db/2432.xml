    <body>I&apos;ve come to collect a parcel &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/lariam-precio-espaa-83f5.pdf&quot;&gt;malaria lariam preis&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;When I was first starting out, I was considered hip for about two seconds,&amp;rdquo; says Joel, &amp;ldquo;and immediately after that I was naff - isn&amp;rsquo;t that the word?&amp;rdquo; How does he feel about that now? &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very superficial way to judge things,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;just to be cool doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a whole lot of substance to it anyway.&amp;rdquo; That Joel is not accorded the critical respect accorded to peers such as Springsteen and Neil Young seems unfair and perverse: anyone whose back catalogue includes Piano Man, Movin&amp;rsquo; Out (Anthony&amp;rsquo;s Song) and Only The Good Die Young ought not to need defending. Despite having written a boatload of songs that are now timeless standards, Joel became disillusioned with pop music.
