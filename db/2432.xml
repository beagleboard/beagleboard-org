    <body>Your cash is being counted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/kneesthehealthpartnercom-f2c2.pdf#ticket&quot;&gt;medicine.net.au&lt;/a&gt;  Democrats note that their candidate won the 2008 election, and achieved an agenda &amp;ndash; including the health care law &amp;ndash; as a result of that win and the wins of Democrats in Congress. Republicans counter that voters overwhelmingly expressed their disgust with the law in 2010, electing scores of new Republicans to Congress and giving the GOP control of the House. Democrats say that voters had a definitive opportunity in 2012 to undo Obamacare, when Mitt Romney ran on a platform of doing just that. Not only was Romney defeated, but Democrats picked up seats in both the House and Senate.
