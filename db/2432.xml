But that was just the start of a line rebuilding project that shouldâve began in 2011 when Shaun OâHara and Rich Seubert were cut. Now, with so many veterans hurt, their inexperience is glaring.

Customers get text and email alerts when theyve used most of the electricity theyve paid for. By paying attention to their use they use less, which lowers their bills further. Prepaid customers can have their power cut more quickly, though, if they have trouble paying for more electricity. In Texas, for example, if a prepaid balance falls below a certain level, power can be cut in as little as a day after the power provider issues a warning.
