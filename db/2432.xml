I am more worried about food and housing. Who cares about insurance when you have nothing. These people are so out of touch with reality that they justify taxation as a means for productivity. The health care industry is rubbing their greedy hands for years about this and cant wait to steal. This will fail as people will revolt and the streets will burn. The amount of tax the impose has gone over the edge. Proof of a society that has wakened and more alert to the lies and theft. They will not take part in the society anymore. The only way to free yourself is to break away from the needs of others.
