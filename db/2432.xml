    <body>We&apos;re at university together &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/crc1pharmediumcom-83f5.pdf&quot;&gt;bestofchinesemedicine.com&lt;/a&gt;  But Louie said he encountered a few patients he couldnât help through traditional methods. Either they had swallowing problems and couldnât tolerate a tube down the throat or they had incontinence problems and couldnât retain an enema.
