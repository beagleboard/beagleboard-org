    <body>I was born in Australia but grew up in England &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/beast-super-test-cycle-2206.pdf#flood&quot;&gt;beast super test order&lt;/a&gt;  Britain has the worldâs third-largest stock of foreign direct investment after the United States and China. But multinational companies, which have used Britain as a hub in part because it has access to the single market, would curtail their investment if that was no longer so. The City of London, the UKâs most successful industry, would also suffer if it was cut off from its European hinterland.
