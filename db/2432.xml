    <body>I was made redundant two months ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlam.com/index.php/stmap_77410.html?cialis.nitrofurantoin.optivar&quot;&gt;bgs beard growth spray review&lt;/a&gt;  Brown lost to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and a re-run against Sen. Ed Markey would probably not be more successful. Markey is a much better legislator than a candidate, but he&apos;s a veteran lawmaker with a lot of chits around the state, and a solid, loyal Democrat in a state that is still quite liberal. Bay Staters have also historically shown much more of a willingness to vote for a Republican for governor than for the Senate or even the House. And New Hampshire? The carpet-bagger tag would not serve him well.
