    <body>How many weeks&apos; holiday a year are there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/stmap_f2ef0.html?levofloxacin.viagra.dexamethasone&quot;&gt;effects of prostaglandin&lt;/a&gt;  What else can the Government do but provide financial assistance to those failing? Which brings us to another problem: where will the money actually go? A hospital is like a large organism. Problems with A&amp;E departments can be seen as symptomatic of problems within the hospital itself. That people are left waiting on trolleys in corridors is not necessarily an issue with A&amp;E &amp;ndash; it can be because there are no beds on the wards. There are no beds on the wards because of staff cutbacks or infection outbreaks or space limitations. And, of course, the risk of infection outbreaks is greater with increased bed occupancy rates. In many of the newer hospitals, financed under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), the number of beds has been reduced by up to 30 per cent, meaning many hospitals operate at 100 per cent occupancy most of the time.
