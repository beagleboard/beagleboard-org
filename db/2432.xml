It wants everyone on board, and has founded industry groups such as the RSPO and a parallel body for soy beans, whose cultivation is blamed for destroying the Amazon, and the Marine Stewardship Council for fisheries. All offer the use of their logos on products from companies that pass muster. But consumers and activists accuse these industry bodies of greenwash.

Two of those three teams will be led by characters from Batman&amp;#8217;s rogues gallery while the third team will be made up of only two players who will take control of the dynamic duo themselves. The Joker and Bane gangs work against each other to seize and hold a command post that is placed in the center of any given map. From here on out the dynamic of the two groups works similar to that of rush in Battlefield 3.
