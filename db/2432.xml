If you&apos;re interested in giving Microsoft&apos;s free app a go, you know where to find it.

Bush&apos;s 2001 No Child Left Behind initiative sparked a nationwide debate over how much to rely on testing. Many teachers and educational experts have complained that &quot;teaching the test&quot; is counterproductive to helping students truly learn.

Rogoff and Reinhart are rightfully regarded as careful, honest scholars. Anyone close to the process of economic research will recognize that data errors like the ones they made are distressingly common. Â Indeed the JP Morgan risk models in use when the London Whale trade was placed had errors not unlike those made by RR. In the future, authors and journals and commentators need to devote more effort to replicating significant results before broadcasting them widely. More generally, no important policy conclusion should ever be based solely on a single statistical result. Â Policy judgments should be based on the accumulation of evidence from multiple studies done with differing methodological approaches. Even then, there should be a reluctance to accept conclusions from &amp;#8220;models&amp;#8221; without an intuitive understanding of what is driving them. It is right and understandable that scholars want their findings to inform the policy debate. But they have an obligation to discourage and on occasion contradict those who would oversimplify and exaggerate their conclusions.

A comet can fall into the Sun. The SOHO spacecraft has observed many suicidal comets. A comet, called a sungrazer, may pass so close to the Sun that the tidal forces will fragment the comet into several pieces. Or a comet may simply evaporate after a close encounter. Comets have also been known to be ejected from the solar system as they are sling-shotted around the Sun.
