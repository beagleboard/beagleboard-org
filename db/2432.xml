    <body>Yes, I love it! &lt;a href=&quot;http://teerandaz.com/stmap_131c0.html?mastigra.viagra.acetate&quot;&gt;maxifort zimax 100mg&lt;/a&gt;  Geno Smith is making a strong run through the first 10 days of training camp to beat out Mark Sanchez. It&apos;s probably better for Smith to start the season as the backup because the lack of talent on the Jets will make early success difficult. But if Smith is clearly the better player, Rex Ryan will have no choice â he will have to start him. Two reasons: If Smith gives him a better chance to win, it gives Ryan a better chance to keep his job. And if Smith is the better player and Ryan starts Sanchez, he will lose credibility in the locker room. That being said, let&apos;s see what happens when Smith plays Friday night in Detroit in his first preseason game. The success last year of rookies Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III and Russell Wilson has changed the expectations on how quickly rookie quarterbacks can excel. In 1998, Peyton Manning started from his first game as a rookie with the Colts. Indy was 3-13 and Manning threw 26 TDs and 28 INTs. Last season. Luck also was the opening day starter and was 11-5 with the Colts, threw 23 TDs and 18 INTs and made the playoffs.
