But I guess after they watched &apos;Iron Giant,&apos; they come up with this idea of taking the strangest Marvel character we know, or the strangest Marvel character to ever hit film, and they thought about what I could do with that with motion-capture and my voice. That&apos;s what they presented. It&apos;s something that&apos;s interesting, and a really great idea on behalf of Marvel. Now it&apos;s just up to my reps to allow that to happen.&quot;
