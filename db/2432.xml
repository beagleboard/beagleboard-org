    <body>I&apos;d like to send this to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/privatemedsco-review-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;privatemeds.co review&lt;/a&gt;  The brew: Doughnut Plant hired head barista Drew DeGeer to revive its coffee business â and in six months, he says java sales have increased twofold. Why? The company now treats coffee-and-donut pairings like wine pairings. âTwo years ago, Doughnut Plant was selling decaf under the guise of it being regular coffee,â DeGeer says. âTheyâve made a huge investment in equipment and taken great steps forward.â

Forget two seasons hence. Given the advanced ages of Garnett (37) and Pierce (35), the Nets need to make it work in 2013-14. Thatâs why the Jason Kidd move made no sense, but who are we to tell Mikhail Prokhorov whom to hire? We suggested Lionel Hollins and heâs still looking for work.
