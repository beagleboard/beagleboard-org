Rodriguez â who has missed the entire 2013 season after hip surgery in January â would miss the rest of this year and the entire 2014 season if he was suspended for 200 or more games. The aging infielder turned 38 years old last week, and a comeback in 2015 would be highly unlikely since he would be pushing 40 and sidelined for two full seasons at that point.
