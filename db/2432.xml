They volunteered the comparison. And the military uses these games for simulation of real-life experiences. The games are very realistic and thatâs the difference between them and T.V. and film. In games, you are using a mouse or a joystick and you are interacting with the content and that makes it much easier to internalize the violent actions that are going on.â
