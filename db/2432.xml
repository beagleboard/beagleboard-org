Buddy Ryan encouraged Weeks to commence the coaching life at the high school level, and Weeks returned home to lead the freshman team at Bartlesville High. He employed Ryanâs vaunted 46 Defense, pressuring opponents with it on every down. The Bruins went 8-1 that season. Next, he picked up a masterâs degree in physical education from Morehead State as a graduate assistant alongside the Ryan brothers in Kentucky. His first head coaching position came in Ellinwood, Kan., a small German community of wheat farmers. Bred a Baptist, Weeks joined the Lutheran congregation to better understand the religious townâs population. It was 90 minutes from Dodge City and a popular place previously during Prohibition due to its intricate underground tunnels.
