    <body>Will I have to work on Saturdays? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikasafloors.com/menshealthabrilcombr-bdec.pdf#quicker&quot;&gt;menshealth.abril.com.br&lt;/a&gt;  Survey for April 2012 to March 2013. Who completed these surveys, from which social class and where were they based? Did those who can&apos;t read English or wont read participate? Were blind or partial sighted people fairly included or the severely disabled or those with learning difficulties? Were those living in care and nursing homes asked or the homeless? The ONS does not liberate on that.
