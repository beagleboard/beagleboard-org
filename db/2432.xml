I was the editor of TheHeart.Org from its inception in 1999 until December 2008. Following the purchase of TheHeart.Org by WebMD in 2005, I became the editorial director of WebMD professional news, encompassing TheHeart.Org and Medscape Medical News. Prior to joining TheHeart.Org, I was a freelance medical journalist and wrote for a wide variety of medical and computer publications. In 1994-1995 I was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT. I have a PhD in English from SUNY Buffalo, and I drove a taxicab in New York City before embarking on a career in medical journalism. You can follow me on Twitter at: @cardiobrief.

This coup buried democracy,&amp;#8221; declared one pro-Mursi protester.

Yelp has been battling fake reviews for years, and the Times reports that fake review operations in general have been increasing in sophistication, writing subtler copy that is not so easy to detect as an overt shill. In addition, the fake reviewers have taken to review sites to defend themselves, the Times reports in one particularly surreal paragraph:

At the same point last year, the group had beeninvolved in 63 cases and in 2011 it was 58.
