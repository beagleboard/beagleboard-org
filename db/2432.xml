He let himself in, sat down, and called the police, reporting his wife as a missing person. (Neither he nor Joyce owned a mobile phone.) &amp;ldquo;After that I went to one of the busy intersections to look for her car but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t there,&amp;rdquo; he says. At about 9pm, a policeman suggested that he should check the local high school which had been designated as a meeting point and nerve centre for an enormous aid distribution programme that would begin that night and last for weeks.
