    <body>I&apos;m in my first year at university &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/compounding-pharmacy-of-green-5168.pdf#head&quot;&gt;compounding pharmacy of green uniontown oh&lt;/a&gt;  Betty Diamond, a physician and immunologist at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, agrees that &quot;there&apos;s more work to be done,&quot; before such a diagnostic test is ready for prime time. &quot;If you&apos;re using this to determine the likelihood that someone is going to have a child with ASD,&quot; which might influence the decision to have a baby or not, she says, &quot;you want a very, very strong degree of certainty.&quot; However, she says, &quot;this is a very exciting approach, because if this indeed contributes to some proportion of cases of ASD then there is a way to identify risk pregnancies and also a way to think about prevention&quot; with drugs such as antibody blockers, or to begin early interventions, such as behavioral therapy, that have been shown to improve how autistic children fare long-term.
