I think that would be unnecessary.â She added: âIt is absolutely the most important vote that I will cast in my lifetime, and I am sure that goes for my parents as well. Because, if we were to vote âyesâ, thatâs for keeps. I donât want to have to choose between feeling Scottish and British.â
