Some details became public after one of Kempnerâs former patients sued him and Duke in 1993.

I don&apos;t agree with what my brother is saying. Riley is still my teammate and he just stood in front of us and apologized for what he said. Somewhere deep down you&apos;ve got to find some level of respect for that.
