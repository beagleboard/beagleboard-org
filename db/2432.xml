However, it has hidden powers. They spring from its reluctance to form compounds with other elements unless forced to do so by heat, pressure, powerful chemicals, or complex biological tricks. That is because nitrogen has a valency &amp;ndash; a bonding power &amp;ndash; of three. The oxygen in the atmosphere consists of a pair of atoms joined by a double bond; the nitrogen also comes in pairs, but this time held by three connections. Those ties are strong &amp;ndash; but when they break, nitrogen will fall into bed with anything that will have it, making laughing gas, cyanide, superglue and more. It is particularly happy to combine with oxygen to generate the raw material of dynamite and its fellows.
