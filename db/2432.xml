All that was missing was a polar bear. Many of our fellow passengers, from the United States and China, had crossed half the planet for their once-in-a-lifetime polar bear sighting. By now the crew had doubled their efforts, on watch 24 hours a day, using powerful binoculars to look out for anything bearlike. The grey skies looked pretty much the same at 3am as they did at 3pm, so a good night-time sighting was more than possible. It was rather like being on a natural-history film shoot, where &amp;ldquo;wildlife law&amp;rdquo; always seems to dictate that the animal you want to film rarely arrives until the eleventh hour.
