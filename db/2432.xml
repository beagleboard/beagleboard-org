His grandfather was a miner; his father killed 13 Germans single-handed in the First World War and told his alcoholic CO: &amp;ldquo;Throw that whisky bottle away or I&amp;rsquo;ll shoot you.&amp;rdquo; Wilfred was educated at Crook council school and Scarborough College. As a boy he revelled in tales of the French Foreign Legion and longed to see the Sahara; when he finally got there, in 1966, it was raining.
