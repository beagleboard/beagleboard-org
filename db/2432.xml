It would be patronising to explain the film&amp;rsquo;s loose grip on plausibility as something unlikely to bother the target demographic. The moments of horror and awe here, such as the late discovery of a major character in a body bag, feel like token injections of bleakness into a pleasant enough teen romance; that sting of anarchic dread revealed in something like Lord of the Flies is far too harsh for the film to contemplate.

Someone lucky enough to graduate when the economy is booming and unemployment is low will spend relatively little time searching for his first job, creating a virtuous cycle that leads to more time employed at higher wages throughout his life. Or imagine someone who ten years ago could choose between working for Lehman Brothers or J.P. Morgan; it would have been impossible to know that, five years later, one would be bankrupt and the other not, but that decision would have profound consequences for his lifetime earnings.
