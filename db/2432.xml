For the past couple of years, a growing number of institutional investors have expressed concerns over Rupert Murdochâs holding the role of CEO and chairman and the dual voting stock. Several of the largest and most well-regarded investors in the world have challenged the structure of the company and its corporate governance â and have been completely disregarded.

For that is surely where this government wants this conversation to end up: the NHS is unsustainable. This is a convenient myth to explain the next myth, that &quot;things can&apos;t go on like this&quot;. The fact is that it is not a given that changing demographics and new drugs necessarily lead to accelerated costs. We must challenge the myths and the figures.
