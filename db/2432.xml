    <body>Three years &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/mava-sports-uk-6ae3.pdf&quot;&gt;mava sports uk&lt;/a&gt;  German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich (pictured fourth from left) welcomed 107 Syrians, half of them children, on the tarmac of Hanover&apos;s airport on Wednesday. Germany&apos;s 16 regional states agreed last March to host 5,000 civil-war refugees for two years.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/flavorx-compounding-syrup-3c56.pdf#cooperative&quot;&gt;flavorx formulary&lt;/a&gt;  Banks, here in New York, if I needed access to capital in the past I had to supplicate myself, prostate myself before big banks and say, &amp;#8220;Please, please, please give me money.&amp;#8217; Now we don&amp;#8217;t have to do that; we&amp;#8217;ve got Kickstarter and we&amp;#8217;ve got Kiva as democratizing access to capital. We&amp;#8217;ve got forces that are democratizing work. One of my friends, again from the Bay area-Stanford community, started [SOMA Source] taking micro tasks and using them in developing nations, giving people internet hook ups and liberating their economic potential. I&amp;#8217;ve got friends that are liberating in the United States using technology to better monetize their very being with collaborative consumption from Uber and AirBNB and Lift. I&amp;#8217;m seeing in every sector education and how online Stanford courses are now being taken by people in developing nations who are outperforming Stanford students. We&amp;#8217;re creating greater access, we&amp;#8217;re creating greater equality. Somebody, just because they&amp;#8217;re in a certain geography or a certain race or a certain sexual orientation, or certain socio-economic status, are being liberated. In fact, I listened to a presentation from a guy who has a company called Huge, which I thought should be my company given my size, who said, &amp;#8220;Look, we&amp;#8217;re talking people with a formal education in the ninth grade. But we&amp;#8217;re seeing that people who are learning coding in college half of that stuff is not even useful anymore.&amp;#8217; The whole way we think about education is wrong. In fact, we don&amp;#8217;t have an unemployment problem in America; we have a training and education problem in America. They were hiring people with six figure salaries who maybe only had a ninth grade education because that&amp;#8217;s how demand people in coding is. Why isn&amp;#8217;t our education system reflecting this demand that we have?

They&apos;re there because they representÂ  who we are &amp;ndash; a nation that cares for its own, whether it&apos;s hungry people or a family who needs to bury a servicemember.
