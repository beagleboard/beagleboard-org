Isn&amp;#8217;t that the obvious question? The US government doesn&amp;#8217;t do something unless someone, or some key industry, is profiting (not to be confused with profiting in such a way as to create jobs in the US.

Surely our Presidents don&amp;#8217;t keep doing these deals without reason, even if that reason does hurt Americans (which is usually the case). Why do we continue letting ourselves get screwed?
