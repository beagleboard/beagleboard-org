 &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/uroprin-uti-2206.pdf#swindle&quot;&gt;uroprin review&lt;/a&gt;  Dennis Farina, a former Chicago police officer plucked off the beat to become a prolific actor in crime sagas on the big and small screens, died on July 22, 2013 after suffering a blood clot in his lung. He was 69. The actor -- who started in showbiz as a police consultant for &quot;Miami Vice&quot; creator Michael Mann on the 1981 movie &quot;Thief&quot; -- passed away in a Scottsdale, Ariz., hospital, his rep told the Associated Press. Farina broke through as the tough-as-nails Lt. Mike Torello over three seasons of the TV drama, &quot;Crime Story.&quot; Farina went on to straddle the law on screen with equal aplomb with standout turns as mobsters in &quot;Midnight Run&quot; and &quot;Get Shorty.&quot; From 2004 through 2006, Farina returned to the right side of the law with a memorable ongoing role on &quot;Law &amp; Order.&quot;
