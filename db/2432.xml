Those high temperatures will bring with them the potential for severe storms and flooding in December and February along the central and western Gulf Coasts.

These tests are based on data as of March 31, projected out to 2015. Banks were ordered to release the summary results of these tests to the broader public between September 15 and September 30.

The only thing he&amp;#8217;s doing is garnering publicity. Everyone in the Senate knows it. Most intelligent Americans, those who are even paying any attention, know it. But Cruz has figured that there are enough idiot Tea Party pathogens who will buy into anything they&amp;#8217;re told to make this little clown show of his pay off. Here&amp;#8217;s a guy who gets all his and his family&amp;#8217;s healthcare paid for by tax payers and an annual salary of $174,000 for railing against the government that he personally benefits from so handsomely. He doesn&amp;#8217;t care if the government shuts down. He doesn&amp;#8217;t care if millions of Americans can&amp;#8217;t afford healthcare. He doesn&amp;#8217;t care about anything except himself. Anyone who supports this traitor should have the word &amp;#8220;idiot&amp;#8221; stamped on their forehead.

I remember having a discussion with colleagues, what if they donât shake hands? What if they sign a document look at each other, turn around and head back into the White House? How disappointing would that be for everyone? It didn&amp;#8217;t take long before the ceremony began and all the participants arrived on stage to take their marked spots. The documents were signed. Everyone stood up and all I remember was a pause &amp;#8211; a pause that seemed like and eternity when Arafat and Rabin didn&amp;#8217;t exactly know what to do next. With what seemed like a small little nudge from President Clintonâs outstretched arms, PLO Chairman Arafat reached first in the direction of Prime Minister Rabin who sported what seemed like a little puzzled look before he himself put his hand firmly into Arafatâs.
