They may think they are better off for it but should realize some facts before purchasing in their stores. They pay wages so low 20% of their workforce is on public assistance, SNAP, medicaid, housing subsidies, with nearly all using the EIC. Over 90% of the manufactured goods come from China with WalMart execs telling buyers to use Chinese suppliers. WalMart sales of Chinese made has closed thousands of US factories. The 6 Walton billionaires have more total dollars than 150 million Americans together. They have discriminated against women in their workforce (conservative SCOTUS said single cases, class action suits are not allowed)m have cheated workers out of overtime, have hired part timers to replace full timers to avoid paying benefits. Americans that harm America for more money are like our modern day Benedict Arnolds using the boardroom as their weapon.

In the past, ELA covered a wide swath of content but was often very shallow. Thatâs why many of our graduates require remediation when they get to college. Now, the focus is on teaching our students to read and write about fiction and nonfiction so that they deeply understand the texts, and communicate that understanding.
