    <body>I&apos;m on holiday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/apcalis-ou-kamagra-31f1.pdf#neighbour&quot;&gt;kamagra cena apteka&lt;/a&gt;  Johnson and Rehavi found that non-physician mothers who gave birth in non-HMO-owned hospitals were indeed more likely to have C-sections than non-physician mothers with similar characteristics who gave birth in HMO-owned hospitals. That supports the claim that doctors&apos; financial incentives play at least some role in their treatment of uninformed patients. But there&apos;s even stronger evidence for the physician-induced demand hypothesis: it turns out that physician-mothers were about equally likely to have C-sections regardless of whether they gave birth at an HMO-owned hospital. In other words, financial incentives don&apos;t seem to affect the choice of treatment for informed patients.
