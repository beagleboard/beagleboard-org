    <body>Until August &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/omegapharmainvestcom-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;omegapharmainvest.com&lt;/a&gt;  Long-term survival was not assessed, as this would have subjected both sets of mice to unnecessary cruelty. The terminally sick mice were sacrificed at 12 weeks. The treated mice lost more than 20% of their body weight, which meant they had to be culled in accordance with UK Home Office regulations. They also had elevated blood glucose levels, but below the diabetic range in mice.
