    <body>Is there ? &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/dromoredoctorssurgerycom-9392.pdf#thinking&quot;&gt;getwellpharmacies.com&lt;/a&gt;  After World War II showed our species just how many hells on earth it could create, a whole generation of researchers devoted themselves to what I find a much more vital question. &quot;Why do apparently good and normal people do abnormal and appalling things ?&quot; Interestingly, those post-war researchers - psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists - found answers to that question. They found reliable, repeatable results which offer a map we could follow to better places, a guide we could offer to children everywhere, as necessary as instructions on how to cross roads safely - how to be human safely, how not to behave like a sociopath.
