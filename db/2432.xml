It is not a startup any more.&quot; He points to the contradictory nature of Sony&apos;s camera business. It supplies high-end lenses to Apple for low margins, damaging its own business.

This time, we are headed to Cotton Island. Once a camp is set, Dusty decides to check the rocky headland at the end of the landing beach. After checking under boulders and crevasses for any suspicious items, the patrol comes across the entrance to a small cave. With the best intentions of fulfilling their duty of reconnaissance and surveillance, the soldiers enter the cave. What happens next made me realize just how strong the traditions of Australiaâs indigenous people still are. The cave turned out to be a burial site, thus an extremely precious and sensitive area known as a Sacred Site to the local people. Quickly realizing this, the NORFORCE soldiers bid a hasty retreat and are visibly shaken and upset. Dustyâs experience at dealing with such an issue becomes obvious at this moment. He sits the soldiers down, and explains to them that their mission is to investigate and report any possible places that illegal activities could occur, and a cave is one such obvious place. He adds that the cave would now be marked as a Sacred Site, and NORFORCE would keep away from it during any future patrols, unless accompanied by a local elder. Then, very quietly, Private Jonah Thingle walks back to the entrance of the cave, and speaking in his traditional language, apologizes to the spirits present within the cave for having disturbed them. The indigenous soldiers were so shaken and uncomfortable after this incident, that it wasn&amp;#8217;t until we had left the island, did they start to relax and become their cheerful selves again. This experience showed me that such significant and spiritual places are of extreme importance to the Aborigines, and as someone who is basically still a newcomer to this ancient land, it reinforces just how important it is to leave such significant places alone.
