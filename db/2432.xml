The newlyweds had a party at New York event space Capitale to celebrate their recent nuptials and arrival in NYC. It might not have been as lavish as their celebrity-studded, over-the-top Montecito, Calif. wedding, but it was certainly close.The party, thrown for Kardashian, 30, and Humphries, 26, by magazine magnate Jason Binn and wedding planner to the stars Colin Cowie, drew a crowd of famous faces. Guests included Lala Vasquez, Lance Bass, &apos;The Real Housewives of New York&apos; cast members Alex McCord, Ramona Singer and Sonja Morgan, as well as Kardashian&apos;s sister Kourtney and boyfriend Scott Disick.
