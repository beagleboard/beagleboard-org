They still don&amp;#8217;t have the leadership including a fresh Board of Directors to move ahead instead of wallowing in their failure and missed opportunities. The creativity needed is already in place i.e. it e employees who are undervalued, mismanaged and blamed for the failures of the leadership and Board.
