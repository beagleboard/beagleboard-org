He was moved to second by Miguel Tejada&apos;s sacrifice bunt and then pinch-run for by Jarrod Dyson, who scored on a wild pitch that Wheeler bounced in front of the plate. Wheeler then walked Eric Hosmer and Alex Gordon reached on Byrd&apos;s error, missing the ball again in the sun. They both scored on Lorenzo Cain&apos;s line drive to right, which Byrd bobbled. Cain took second on Wheeler&apos;s second wild pitch of the inning. After walking Moustakas, and the runners advanced on a passed ball, he got Alcides Escobar to fly out to center. He intentionally walked George Kottaras to get out of the inning by striking out Ervin Santana.
