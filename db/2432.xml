    <body>I&apos;ve got a very weak signal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/biomedicalngcom-e0f9.pdf&quot;&gt;supplementshealthshop.com&lt;/a&gt;  Now the Giants not only have Randle (who had 19 catches for 298 yards and three touchdowns last season), but they also have high hopes for Louis Murphy, a speedy 26-year-old who caught 25 passes for 336 yards in Carolina last season. Heâs the fourth receiver in the offense and maybe the fifth option behind tight end Brandon Myers (who caught 79 passes for 806 yards in Oakland last season). But if Randle really does break out this season, Murphy could be the deep threat in the offense that Manningham and Hixon both once were.
