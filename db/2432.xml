    <body>I came here to work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/immedytmexicocom-6ae3.pdf&quot;&gt;meenaxypharma.com&lt;/a&gt;  As we move into the year, companies and their leaders are under greater scrutiny than ever. In one of my meetings with institutional investors recently, someone asked whether chief executive officers should sit as independent directors on the boards of other companies. CEOs who sit on too many boards risk getting overloaded and splitting their time, energy and commitment to the extent that they do none of their jobs well. Get the balance right, though, and CEOs on outside boards can bring benefits to all the organizations with which they are involved.
