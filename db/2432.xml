The party lost the chance to win two Senate seats last year because of the ill-informed, judgmental and anti-female remarks made by Republican candidates. One, Missourian Todd Akin, said that pregnancy doesn&apos;t happen in cases of &quot;legitimate rape,&quot; since a woman&apos;s body has a way of &quot;shutting that whole thing down&quot; in cases of nonconsensual sex. And Richard Mourdock of Indiana said a pregnancy from a rape was a gift from God. If Republicans want to keep alienating female voters, they&apos;re on the right track.

But you should work out the terms beforehand explicitly &amp;ndash; and should stay aware HR is still required to report certain things, like harassment or illegal behavior, even if they agreed to confidentiality before hearing your report.
