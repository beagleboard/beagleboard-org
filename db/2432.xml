    <body>I&apos;d like to send this parcel to  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/old-school-new-body-ebook-free-download-e0f9.pdf#born&quot;&gt;old school new body workout reviews&lt;/a&gt;  So is this the most important scientific happening of the day? No, probably not. But it is, for my money, the most exciting. Science, in the public imagination, is ... scientific. It is data-driven and analytic and divorced, by design, from human emotion. But this split-second falling of a lump of liquid-y tar is a nice reminder of the excitement that can be embedded in even the dullest of experiments. The drop of pitch may simply have proved what we already knew. But it was a drop of pitch that was 69 years in the making. It was the drop of pitch we had been waiting for.
