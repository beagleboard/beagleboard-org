    <body>How much does the job pay? &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?parlodel.minocycline.levitra&quot;&gt;lemed.com.sg&lt;/a&gt;  Juror Kevin Smith, 61, who works for Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, added: &quot;If AEG had known what was going on behind closed doors it would probably have made a world of difference, but they didn&apos;t.&quot;

Maybe that will change in the coming weeks but for right now, meh.
