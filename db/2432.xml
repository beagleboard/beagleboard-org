    <body>I went to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/urgmedcz-2206.pdf#glare&quot;&gt;profimed.cz&lt;/a&gt;  A. Yeah, I don&apos;t want to be a mayor who sees it as his job to poke into the private lives of people who work for the City of New York. I want to know that someone is going to do a good job. I want someone who when he sets out to fix potholes, he&apos;s doing it. I want someone who figures out why a catch basin is overflowing in south east Queens. And when a cop is out pounding a beat in a tough precinct he&apos;s doing it to the best of his ability. You can say that I don&apos;t like what Weiner did in his private life. If you think that&apos;s important to your calculation for mayor then don&apos;t vote for me. I get that.
