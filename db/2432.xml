I think the sense of ownership people in Britain feel over Diana, still &amp;ndash; they did when she was alive and they do now &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a testament really to her power, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? You almost feel with this film being released that it&amp;rsquo;s like it&amp;rsquo;s reopening some wound in the national psyche. Because it&amp;rsquo;s very interesting in the sense of how the Americans reacted to it&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; How did they react? &amp;ldquo;Very favourably. They saw it as a love story between two people.&amp;rdquo; So do the negative reviews in the UK speak of Britain&amp;rsquo;s different relationship with Diana? &amp;ldquo;Possibly, yeah.

Cooper had two long touchdown catches, both vs. the Patriots first-team defense. The first one came from Michael Vick, who lofted the ball to Cooper in the corner of the endzone. The pass required Cooper to jump over the defender to make the catch. It was the kind of play that only Cooper is capable of making on this roster, and likely why he is still here.
