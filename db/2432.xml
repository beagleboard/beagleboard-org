    <body>Punk not dead  &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/pharmakey-gmbh-7ef0.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmakey gmbh&lt;/a&gt;  Randy W. Schekman (UC Berkeley) and Thomas Südhof (Stanford University) shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine with James E. Rothman of Yale University for their research on protein transport in cells, andhow cells control this trafficking to secrete hormones and enzymes, which illuminated the workings of afundamental process in cell physiology. The Nobel Assembly lauded Rothman, Schekman and Südhof formaking known &quot;the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellularcargo. Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such asneurological diseases, diabetes, and immunological disorders.&quot; The research of Schekman, a professor of molecular and cell biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, about how yeast secrete proteins has contributed to thesuccess of the biotechnology industry, which was able to coax yeast to release useful protein drugs,such as insulin and human growth hormone. Südhof, professor of molecular and cellular physiology, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, has spent the past 30 years prying loose the secrets of the synapse, the all-important junction where information, in the form of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, is passed from one neuron to another.
