    <body>What do you like doing in your spare time? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlam.com/index.php/stmap_77410.html?prandin.levitra.clobetasol&quot;&gt;claritin d rxlist&lt;/a&gt;  Boards need to change, and serving on a board needs to be considered a job, not an annuity. As board members we are treated very well. We are sent manicured board papers in advance of board meetings. We are collected at the airport, transported to meetings, treated to lovely meals, and given slick and painstakingly prepared presentations. If we are not careful, we can become too comfortable, complacent, and we wonât have a fingertip feel for the organization.
