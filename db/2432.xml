    <body>I&apos;d like to speak to someone about a mortgage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/stmap_e3c40.html?januvia.benadryl.levitra&quot;&gt;cell technology signaling&lt;/a&gt;  I do worry about Romney drinking the &amp;#8220;free trade&amp;#8221; kool-aid a little too deeply, based on what I&amp;#8217;ve heard him say about that â but OBAMA has been drinking that kool-aid too! With economic policy, Obama seems to have been carried along with the Zeitgeist, and bamboozled by all the Washington &amp;#8220;experts&amp;#8221; at his disposal, and too easily led into legislative quagmires by congressional Republicans. As in the first presidential debate, he came into office with a prepared script, and found himself parachuted into a totally different drama to the one he had anticipated. Without knowing economics back-to-front, Obama didn&amp;#8217;t know how to adapt!
