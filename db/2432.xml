The 6-3 220-pounder then stated he was going to go home to West Virginia over the draft snub. Smith had a change of heart, returned to the draft that Friday and was taken by the Jets. Had the Jets taken Smith ninth overall, as they did with CB Dee Milliner, he would have been entitled to close to $12 million.
