Adopting a New England accent, Hanks is bold and vulnerable, at once steadfast and smart, then incredibly human and fallible. Phillips is first introduced to his crew as a no-nonsense supervisor, the all-work-and-no-play type who receives frequent eye-rolls from his team. But this natural leadership saves their lives as the ship comes under attack from four Somali pirates. His quick thinking keeps him and the crew one step ahead of the Somali pirates and itâs his quick-on-the-draw survivor skills that are most impressive to watch. But as Phillips becomes the lone hostage on a life raft racing back to the Somali coast, Phillipsâ fear, stress and pain hijack logic and replace it will instinctual and brute survival, which is highly unpredictable and dangerous.

The deal for ExactTarget closed in July and helped boost Salesforce&apos;s revenue figures for the second quarter, the company said.
