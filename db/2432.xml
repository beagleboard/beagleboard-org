To say Zimmerman had done nothing wrong at all is denial. I sure hope I never see some strange guy with a loaded gun running me down. Frankly, I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I&amp;#8217;d do, but if I&amp;#8217;m packing there might be a shootout. I hate seeing our society depend so much on guns rather than our brains. But that&amp;#8217;s the direction we&amp;#8217;re going in. We tried it before during the 19th Century and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out so well. Only a fool would think that somehow this round will be different. Americans never seem to learn.

Over the past couple of years two of our best players have been Alastair Cook and Matt Prior. So far they have not performed. Prior has been magnificent in recent years. His wicketkeeping has improved beyond all recognition from when he started and his batting has been superb under pressure when we have been in trouble. For example, his century in Auckland to save the series in March was a great effort and helped him win the England Player of the Year award. But since then he has had scores of 0, 0, 39, 4 not out, 1, 31, 6 and 1 not out.
