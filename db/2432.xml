    <body>Through friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/bystrictin-realty-31f1.pdf#coat&quot;&gt;bystrictin realty&lt;/a&gt;  My initial column on Snowden was predicated on the belief that, really, nothing he revealed was new. Didnât members of Congress know all this stuff and hadnât much of it leaked? Yes, thatâs largely true. But my mouth is agape at the sheer size of these data-gathering programs â a cascade of news stories that leads me to conclude that this very column was known to the NSA before it was to my editors.
