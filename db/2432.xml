    <body>Could I have a statement, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/drugpossessionlawscomgeorgia-6865.pdf&quot;&gt;medicalobserver.com.au&lt;/a&gt;  VAN HOLLEN: Jon, look there&amp;#8217;s a reason Republicans senators like Senator McCain and others are saying this is absolutely insane because the Republican proposition here is they&amp;#8217;re going to shut down the government if they can&amp;#8217;t deny health care to millions of Americans, including millions of kids who are right now benefiting from the Affordable Care Act, kids with pre-existing conditions who can no longer be thrown off of their insurance policies.

Yes, we do disagree with him! Yes, we do think he is a radical! No, we have no interest in seeing his policies become the policies of this country. If he wants to continue to act like a spoiled child over the fact that he holds a minority view of this country&amp;#8217;s future, great! I hope he whine and cries and excoriates the rest of us, right up until the day he is ushered out of the White House for the last time, to be replaced by one who understands and believes in our Constitutional republic.
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/balancedhealthinfo-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;pillixy.com&lt;/a&gt;  when people behave in such a manner they cease to become Muslims, as Islam is not an identity nor a culture, it is a belief and ethics according to the message of the Maker of existence and this type of hostile and primitive conduct is simply the opposite of what God guides people to do in the Quran and earlier âuneditedâ Prophetic messages. When civilized citizens behave in a similar way they won&amp;#8217;t be designated as âcivilizedâ in the media but rather âcriminalsâ. Unless we read a headline that says âA group of civilized people r killing hostages to steal a land and make it their nationââ¦ excluding one exception, but thatâs another story.

Cox, executive director of the NRA&apos;s Institute for Legislative Action. &quot;To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable.&quot;
