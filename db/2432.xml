    <body>We need someone with experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelifesinsurancequotes.com/stmap_6f970.html?femcare.famciclovir.viagra&quot;&gt;keelanelli keerai in english&lt;/a&gt;  Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization, with Soviet support, invaded Jordan in 1970 and threatened to topple King Hussein, a long-time ally of the United States, and replace him with Yasser Arafat, the leader of the PLO. In response, President Richard Nixon ordered the 6th Fleet to anchor off the coast of Israel and Lebanon to rattle the U.S. sabre. He did not announce what he would do, he did not say he would limit U.S. military action and he did not ask for congressional consent. The PLO, Syrian military and their Soviet advisors withdrew from Jordan because they were afraid of what Nixon might do. Nixon&apos;s skillful use of American power to protect our ally provides a valuable lesson for what the U.S. might do in Syria.
