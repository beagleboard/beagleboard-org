Chunks of that Gothic decoration were taken from the building for fear they would come hurtling to the ground. After the great storm of 1987, the delicate lantern on top of the tower was removed, balanced as it was on rotten oak beams. The majestic landmark became a forlorn stump.

Referring to it on one of his weekly radio shows last March, Mayor Bloomberg urged the city&amp;#8217;s taxpayers &amp;#8220;to call their representatives in Albany and say, &amp;#8216;We ain&amp;#8217;t gonna do this anymore.&amp;#8217; &amp;#8221; Had he elaborated, he could have put the blame on literature. New York City has always been a place where reformers have scouted around in poor neighborhoods and written books about what they saw. In &amp;#8220;American Notes&amp;#8221; (1842), Charles Dickens affectingly described the squalor of the Five Points slum in what became Chinatown. Jacob Riis, a Danish immigrant, read Dickens, and later filled his own exposé, &amp;#8220;How the Other Half Lives,&amp;#8221; with heart-wrenching, Dickensian details, backed up by documentary flash photographs, among the first in history. Teddy Roosevelt read Riis, practically hero-worshipped him, and, as Police Commissioner, set about reforming the city&amp;#8217;s housing. Sometimes poetry does make things happen. If you declare, in a famous poem affixed to the Statue of Liberty, in New York Harbor, &amp;#8220;Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me,&amp;#8221; you might consider that a certain commitment has been made.

China has sought to turn it into a safe, family-friendly resort city. It granted gaming concessions to the Las Vegas elite such as Sands, who opened glitzy casinos that dwarf the older ones surrounding Chow&apos;s property.
