    <body>Where do you live? &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/cymbalta-e-testosterone-83f5.pdf&quot;&gt;does cymbalta cause weight gain 2012&lt;/a&gt;  Even though it didn&amp;#8217;t feel unsafe, Williston&amp;#8217;s smallness felt creepy and intrusive the very first time I went. I had to go to the only laundromat that was open on a Sunday, and a customer came up and approached me. He was utterly harmless, but I was shocked that he talked to me instead of politely ignoring me as would be the case just about anywhere else. It&amp;#8217;s another aspect of the collision of city stripper and small-town stripper. When you are a visiting woman who&amp;#8217;s there to entertain, why shouldn&amp;#8217;t you always be entertaining? Going into town, eating in a restaurant while people stare at you &amp;mdash; or you and your friends &amp;mdash; gives you some appreciation for what it must have been like for women of the red-light districts when they went into town at designated times, in groups, to run their errands. You are a public display.
