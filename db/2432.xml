    <body>I&apos;ve got a part-time job &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?flurbiprofen.viagra.ivermectin&quot;&gt;opca-banques.com&lt;/a&gt;  Africa is a clear case study of poor trickle-down of resources. We are yet to have our teeth in the real national cakes. Here is how: Economic figures which are in most cases doctored to paint a rosy picture are only empty words to a majority of poor Africans. Even as we discover bounties of natural, we are sure of one thing; Only our leaders will share the spoils as the masses battle with buffaloes of poverty in our villages and slums. Only our selfish leaders and former colonialists are invited to the banquet to discuss how to share the offing wells of oil in Kenya and Uganda and the gas in Tanzania. Why should authorities in Tanzania insist on piping the gas resources in poor Mtwara province to Dar es Salaam? Why can`t the so-called investors invest in the villages in Mtwara? This is our cardinal sin since independence[ if any]. The bottom line is that the very colonial powers who divided Africa in the Berlin conference of 1884-1885 are the ones eating from the pots of gold with our presidents and prime ministers getting a few remains! Because our leaders are getting the spoils, they are quick at giving sinful tax holidays to the so-called investors.
