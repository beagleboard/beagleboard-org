Sevier County has sent $300,500 to NPS to open it for five days, according to a press release from the governorâs office. The state is paying 80 percent of the cost through a $240,400 tourism grant to Sevier County, with Sevier and Blount counties funding the remaining $60,100 to fully fund operations for five days.

The authors makes valid points. While both these states and the rest of the P5 need to take further arms reduction measures for an eventual disarmament under their NPT agreement. While other nuclear states outside have not given any such commitment.
