How come? Goodyear has invested decades of promotion in the Goodyear Blimp name, flying over countless sporting events.

He could choose one of the firm&apos;s insiders, like Terry Myerson, who heads Microsoft&apos;s operating systems division, or Julie Larson-Green, who runs the hardware and games business. Suggestions for outsiders who could run Microsoft range from the inspired but unlikely â Facebook&apos;s Sheryl Sandberg â to the nuts: ousted Apple mobile software chief Scott Forstall.

What is it about the 70s that left the US feeling so emasculated it was compelled to invite the Reagan wild west approach to economics, security, law enforcement, and social programs to run our nation on nitrous oxide for 8 years that led to the impasse we have been stuck with for decades now between one âsideâ and the other. How many of us went along for the ride knowing full well that some of the policies could never work unless oil spouted from every gulch. We took our share of the endless âtax cutsâ and figured the bill would never come from the endless borrowing while the wealthy needed the massive Treasury instruments to stash their billions when markets were sluggish. Eventually we have to break our PTSD over the 70s and return to normalcy. That strange decade canât dictate our future forever.
