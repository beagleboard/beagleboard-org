Only a few years ago, the iPad couldn&apos;t even run multiple apps simultaneously, but there was no expectation for it to do so, and there is still a gulf between the productive capability of an iPad and even a basic Windows laptop. There is still a gulf between the productive capability of an iPad and even a basic Windows laptop. That&apos;s not the case with a Windows tablet. We expect any device that calls itself a Windows PC to offer the same sort of capability and performance of any other PC. There are actually a (very) few tablets that can legitimately compare to standard PCs, but they do so by offering the same components as laptops&amp;#151;most importantly Intel Core processors. Anything else is a disappointment, but unfortunately, the technology needed to make it happen makes the tablets too expensive.
