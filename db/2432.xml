    <body>Which team do you support? &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/los-alto-pharmacy-los-altos-ca-94022-9392.pdf#dislike&quot;&gt;alto pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  Let&amp;#8217;s call it what it is, war against the American people by big business who want&amp;#8217;s Americans to work for slave wages. Why else did over 100 big companies just recently send a letter to Washington voicing their support for more immigration. What they fail to tell you is that this year alone those same companies have laid off thousands of workers. They want immigration so that there is more competition which means more are willing to take whatever job is available for less money. Why do you think wages are so low in China? Because of their huge population if you don&amp;#8217;t take a job for next to nothing there are 1000 others who will and leave you with nothing. That is what they want to do with American jobs so their profits skyrocket while leaving the American worker powerless and poor! No amnesty! No immigration increases! Close the doors, support,train and give jobs to unemployed Americans first!
