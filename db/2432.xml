    <body>Sorry, I&apos;m busy at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/stmap_83f50.html?claritin.viagra.arjuna&quot;&gt;medicross.co.za&lt;/a&gt;  It was coming up to Valentine&apos;s Day, and they had a poster up extolling their &amp;ldquo;romantic package,&amp;rdquo; that said something like: &amp;ldquo;Â£50 gets you a candlelit dinner for two, with complementary half-bottle of champagne (not to be taken into the main bar area).&amp;rdquo; We had a camcorder, and Steve was doing a conducted tour of the place as Alan. We got outside on the forecourt, with the wind howling and the cars roaring by, and he turned to camera and said: &amp;ldquo;Yes, it&apos;s got everything, but I have to admit, I don&apos;t want to die here.&amp;rdquo; That&apos;s when it struck us that there was some depth to this situation &amp;ndash; a kind of social X-ray of male middle-aged Middle England &amp;ndash; that we could explore.
