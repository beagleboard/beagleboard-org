    <body>I can&apos;t get a signal &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/abilene-online-pharmacycom-9392.pdf&quot;&gt;gogetdrugs.org&lt;/a&gt;  Is offering a pregnant woman a seat on the bus or train sexist? Not at all; it&amp;rsquo;s thoughtful, and an example of the rapidly eroding fine manners for which this country was once known. But it&amp;rsquo;s a question of courtesy, not necessity. You should offer a pregnant woman a seat just as you would offer a seat to a person older than you, or a person who looks a bit more tired than you do. But you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be offended if she says she&amp;rsquo;s fine, and would like to stand.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank estimated in areport last week that JPMorgan&apos;s physical book accounted forsomewhere between a third and two-thirds of its overallcommodities trading operation.

The cost of a college degree has risen sharply as schools work to capture as much of that freely available money as possible. They spend it on baubles designed to attract more students, which make the school a more pleasant place to work but do little to bring about improvements in learning. Much of the money is absorbed by perhaps the least transparent type of expense a school incurs, &quot;administration,&quot; and costs rise while outcomes stay the same (or, as an influx of underprepared kids find themselves unable to keep up with the demands of college, go down over time).
