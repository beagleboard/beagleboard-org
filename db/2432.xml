A breaking news, exclusive about a perceived &amp;#8220;change in tone&amp;#8221; on a board. No deal is being made, they haven&amp;#8217;t the money to buy the company themselves so some un-named and un-mentioned entity is going to have to pony up with the cash, which is doubtful given the lack of success of the much-awaited (by the press and Blackberry fanbois) updated handsets. I understand there are only a limited number of stories out there that matter and that the hack writing the article needs to feed his family, but come on! And the state of the stockmarket players who immediately purchase RIM stock on this non-news item is even more revealing of society.
