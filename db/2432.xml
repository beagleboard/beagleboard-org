    <body>A company car &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelifesinsurancequotes.com/affinityhealthcarecentercom-6f97.pdf#each&quot;&gt;africamedec.com&lt;/a&gt;  Romania is not deterring investors, it wants to keep 4 mountain tops intact and preserve its clean water supply. It should look for alternative ways to spend European Funds to offer better lives for the miners, work in a safe environment and not in destroying what nature built over centuries. In 16 years of this mining project Romania will be let with only 6% of the company&amp;#8217;s profits, without 4 mountain tops and a huge lake of cyanide. This would be the largest open top mining project in Europe in the densely populated area. Such &amp;#8220;investors&amp;#8221; are not welcome in Romania, only be people who are looking for a quick buck, regardless of the outcome. Investors stay away!
