    <body>A financial advisor &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/herbeena-5522.pdf#render&quot;&gt;herbeena&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8220;The money would have been different, the Romney inevitability scenario would have been different,&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;New Hampshire would have been different. Would we have won? I don&amp;#8217;t think so. But South Carolina would have been very different. Who knows what Newt would have done then? Who knows what Rick Perry would have done then? There&amp;#8217;s all sorts of what-ifs.&amp;#8221;
