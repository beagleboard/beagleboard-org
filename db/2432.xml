And Desktone had a very successful business model working with the range of service providers. And we enforced that relationship at our VMworld in Barcelona and how important that event was. And we expect that those are going to continue if not accelerate going into the future. We do expect that. So we will augment that with a vCHS, our hybrid cloud host of service over time, but priority one is to continue to expand the business model that Desktone has been successful with to-date. Also with respect to the financial model, we do think it is critical to the adoption of VDI to continue to work on the financial model and many customers find that they are upside down today due to different aspects of the cost model and thus by improvements in things like our storage cost area, things like flash-based storage making a big step there for hosted and I mean for on-premise, but also vCHS, we expect that the Desktone type service from a cloud operation will have very compelling TCO model for customers as well. Carl, anything to add?
