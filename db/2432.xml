The cylinder is shown with two plugs &amp;ndash; one with a fill tube, the other simply a threaded hole, probably to vent air while the cylinder is filled. The front end of the warhead is very large relative to its tail section. If completely filled with sarin (which has a density of 1.09 kilograms per liter), the gas alone would weigh more than 60 kilograms. That&apos;s an enormous amount of sarin &amp;ndash; much more than would be associated with a standard artillery rocket or artillery shell.
