Without going too much into the particulars, Gary and the gang find themselves in &amp;ldquo;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&amp;rdquo; territory, with the good townspeople of Newton Haven replaced by soulless (but very polite) replicants whose arms snap off like Legos but continue to keep punching.
