    <body>Another year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/andropharma-vigor-pills-6865.pdf&quot;&gt;ropharma brasov angajari&lt;/a&gt;  FMC, GM and Chrysler already offer CNG light trucks (pickups) today. However, total cost for CNG vehicles has to come down significantly before mass adoption will take place. As stated in the article, $10,000 additional cost for the vehicle (at 25,000 miles annually, that cost is recovered in about six years&amp;#8211;150,000 miles). If you add the cost of a home fill system ($4,500) you will have to keep your vehicle for as many as ten years to breakeven. Breakeven needs to get to 5 years before the average consumer will be motivated to make the cutover from conventional fuels.
