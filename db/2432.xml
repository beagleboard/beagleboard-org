    <body>I came here to work &lt;a href=&quot;https://accentresurfacing.com/napajen-pharma-4110.pdf&quot;&gt;greenbrook pharmacy and health foods&lt;/a&gt;  Sinfully delicious pastries called mooncakes are flying off the bakery shelves in Chinatown in the days before the Mid-Autumn Festival â a Chinese lunar holiday that falls on Sept. 19 and commemorates the end of the summer harvest.

For gloominess of aspect, Bellevue is unique, with its high columns near the entryway surmounted by the words &amp;#8220;Psychiatric Hospital&amp;#8221; (the building&amp;#8217;s original function). Bellevue has eight hundred and fifty beds and is also called one of the worst shelters in the city; in general, the smaller shelters are said to be much less bad, and some are even nice. Ellis, the dollar-apiece Newport cigarette seller on the street out front, suggested I go to Intake and register myself if I wanted to see what the place was like; I took his word for it instead. Then I subwayed up to 103rd Street on the Lexington line and walked across the footbridge to Wards Island, where a three-hundred-bed men&amp;#8217;s shelter occupies another former psychiatric hospital. That shelter, called the Charles H. Gay Building, is a lonesome place; constantly you hear the tires bumping on an approach ramp to the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge up above it. I asked a guy sitting on the curb in front of the shelter what he thought of it. He considered for a moment and said, &amp;#8220;Jail&amp;#8217;s worse.&amp;#8221;

It also noted headwinds from tighter U.S. fiscal policy, which could worsen as leaders in Washington fight over a deal to keep the government funded and lift the U.S. debt limit.

It declinedto disclose financial terms.
