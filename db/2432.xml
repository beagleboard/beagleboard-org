    <body>I&apos;d like to take the job &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?bactrim.ditropan.lamictal.viagra&quot;&gt;montelukast tablet uses&lt;/a&gt;  Yes this is an apologia, under the guise of sympathy. I have never once heard of a BDS activist wanting a one-state settlement until you mentioned it here, sounds like obfuscation to me. The ones I have read all call for a two state settlement, under the premise that it is inadmissible to gain territory conquered through war. So, in fact Israel as it is today IS illegitimate, exactly insofar as it occupies Palestinian land. Were it to withdraw to it&amp;#8217;s borders (green line), then there would be nothing to boycott, divest from, or sanction, and it would be free from the calumny it now suffers.
