Itâs as though the floorboards are warped by dashed hopes. Anxieties are so rampant theyâve even been absorbed by the few sticks of furniture. Williams used that idea in the short story âThe Man in the Overstuffed Chair.â Tiffany ingeniously summons that notion in a haunting visual that reminds us how the doomed Laura is always in Tomâs mind.
