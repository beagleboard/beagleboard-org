    <body>Whereabouts in  are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?terramycin.viagra.seroquel&quot;&gt;kamagra jelly hinta&lt;/a&gt;  The man blew himself up inside the vehicle on a busy road on the outskirts of the city in central Syria, the SANA news agency said. It blamed &quot;terrorists&quot;, the term it uses to describe rebel forces trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

The shuttles will never fly again, but they have a different kind of value now. The things they did and the stories they tell can inspire and shame in equal measureâprodding us to make our way back into space and forcing us to explain ourselves if we don&amp;#8217;t. The same is true of the men who flew the early missions. Just last Saturday, the very same Stafford and Cernan, now 82 and 79, flew to Lake Forest, Ill., to attend a rousing 85th birthday celebration for Jim Lovell, the Gemini 9 back-up and the commander of the Apollo 13 mission Andrews missed. All of the men are still active, all of them still travel and work (Lovell only grudgingly agreed to give up flying his own plane last year) and all of them, having done their generation&amp;#8217;s bit to make America a space-faring nation, jolly well expect this generation to carry that effort on. That&amp;#8217;s a message Endeavour&amp;#8217;s victory lap ought to send too.

There has also been a late surge of support for Eleanor Catton, including a number of three figure bets, making her the 11/4 second favourite with Colm Toibin&apos;s The Testament of Mary at 4/1.
