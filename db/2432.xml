He unilaterally fixed the date for what his opponents consider an illegal election, broke an agreement to reform Zimbabwe&amp;rsquo;s deeply compromised machinery for holding the poll, and allowed his acolytes to compile a shambolic voters&amp;rsquo; register. An astonishing number of people who are even older than the president have somehow made it on to the list; remarkably few young Zimbabweans, who are more likely to vote against Mr Mugabe, have been included.
