    <body>Can you hear me OK? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/stmap_58840.html?forte.diamox.cialis&quot;&gt;healthyblenderrecipes.com/recipes/type/green_smoothies&lt;/a&gt;  But this inter-society bargaining occurs in a context in which there&amp;#8217;s already a baked-in directional bias toward increasing the value of technical procedures, which are updated regularly and constantly fine-tuned, rather than cognitive or diagnostic services, which are mostly left alone. It also occurs in a context in which one side is politically weaker than the other. The most important cleavage within the RUC is between specialist doctors, who make the bulk of their money billing for procedures, and primary care doctors, who generate most of their income from office visits. While the primary care docs make up roughly 40 percent of physicians nationwide, they have only 14 percent of the votes on the RUC. Primary care physicians now have four rotating seats on the committee&amp;#8212;up from just two seats a few years ago&amp;#8212;out of a total of twenty-nine voting seats. (Of the thirty-one-doctor panel, two permanent seats are nonvoting positions.) Since a vote passes with a two-thirds majority, their political clout is extremely limited.
