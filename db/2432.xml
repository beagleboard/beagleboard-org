In May 2012, he returned to the Tuloso-Midway Independent School District in Corpus Christi, Texas to coach with the prep team. On the last day of spring drills, he returned an interception, and ran toward the sideline. He juked a defender and tore the patellar tendon in his left knee. He crumpled to the ground, and the players - 120 in all, from freshmen through seniors â surrounded him. They took a knee in respect for Weeks. When he noticed them not running around, he yelled at them.

(There are some great designs for these pods on the web, BTW.) It would take a brave and serious shift in mindset, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s time. Without a power nap, in my experience workers head for the kettle and confectionery at around 4pm, as the (more widely-accepted) alternative. Sure, it gets you through the midafternoon slump &amp;ndash; but with a jolt of caffeine and a blood sugar spike which is definitely less healthy than restorative kip.
