    <body>How many weeks&apos; holiday a year are there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/simson-pharma-limited-0bae.pdf#ankle&quot;&gt;simson pharma pvt ltd&lt;/a&gt;  The study also found some bright spots. Thanks to powerful new medications, HIV and AIDS, which were the 11th leading causes of death and disability in 1990, dropped to 32 in 2010. Road injuries -- such as traffic accidents, once the fourth leading cause of death and disability -- now rank ninth. Birth defects are also taking less of a toll on health. They ranked 20th in 1990, but have dropped to 29th, thanks, in part, to mandatory fortification of grain products with folic acid, which has reduced the number of babies born with devastating neural tube defects, according to the report.
