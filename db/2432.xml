It has major advantages in relation to the regionâs festivals â spectacular location at the fortress, a camp sandwiched five minutes from the city center on one side and five minutes from the city beach on the other side. But if you ask the foreign visitors, 90 percent of whom seem to be from the UK, for their impressions, they tell you only, mouths still agape, that they are astonished how cheap everything is. Of course, they are speaking of the food and drink. Or maybe it is connected to what Wikluh Sky, frontman of Bad Copy, a Belgrade band known for its sarcastic and parodical lyrics, said at the end of his concert: âBeware of Englishmen in civvies.â He was simultaneously riffing on the preponderance of Brits and warning concert-goers about the plainclothes policemen at the festival. Embedded in his admonition is the widely-held sentiment that the festival has lost most of its rebellious spirit both because of the foreigners and the highly organized and fairly heavily policed area.

By your logic, my doctor and his wife, who are 69 and 70 respectively and just married, should not have been allowed to since they cannot conceive nor did they in their first marriages.

Though this approach worked brilliantly for years, there were two big longer-term weaknesses with this plan. Both of them may be coming into play just about now, which would both explain decreasing demand for Chinese goods and make it more difficult for China to cope.
