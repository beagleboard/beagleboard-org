The quest for the elusive Higgs had involved some 6,000 scientists, cost millions of dollars and required billions of particle collisions. &quot;I think we have it,&quot; said Rolf-Dieter Heur, CERN&apos;s director general.Dr. Higgs, now 84, received a round of applause when he entered the auditorium, and shed a tear on hearing the news.
