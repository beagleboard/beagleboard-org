But Steed&apos;s hometown is anything but ordinary. The young people who died weren&apos;t merely partying -- they were violating a strict religious code.

He has embraced this city and the attention, whether itâs being photographed squiring a supermodel to a hockey game or posing in his birthday suit, tastefully, for ESPN the Magazineâs âThe Body Issue.â He boldly proclaims that he wasnât afraid of the so-called Sports Illustrated jinx when the magazine put him on the cover earlier this year.

Apparently, he left out the best tracks. In his cover of âPretty Saro,â he uses his higher âNashville Skylineâ voice to bring us inside the songâs hurt. The take on âTattle OâDayâ has more beauty and tug than the traditional pieces Dylan put on the original, while his run at Eric Andersonâs âThirsty Bootsâ bores a whole new melody into this classic.
