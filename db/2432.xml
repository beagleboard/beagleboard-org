It&amp;#8217;s likely an effort to make the service friendlier to advertisers and brands. Sending DMs to these companies would be a good way for users to communicate with brands without making their messages public. So far, Twitter users have just sent @replies to brand&amp;#8217;s Twitter accounts to send praise and criticism, which are publicly viewable.
