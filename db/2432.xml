Senator John McCain makes a convincing case that America&amp;#39;s credibility and international standing are at stake. Our &quot;credibility&quot; is a meaningful, tangible, irreplaceable American asset in the world. As we are still the world&amp;#39;s most powerful leader and, in essence, the power broker in the Middle East, we will be judged harshly if we do nothing in the wake of a chemical weapons attack by a disreputable regime.

But regardless of how you interpret California it&apos;s still a very, very large increase in claims.&quot; And he also noted that the increase does not reflect new claims by federal workers who have been furloughed, as they are reported separately. (Around 15,000 of the claims did come from private sector workers who rely on federal spending for their jobs.)
