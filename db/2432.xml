    <body>good material thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/kamagra-oral-jelly-banja-luka-ab8a.pdf&quot;&gt;kamagra gel wirkung bei frauen&lt;/a&gt;  Arends asserts that the typical balanced portfolio, which mixes stocks and low-risk bonds, is fatally flawed. He writes (without any support) that both stocks and bonds are &amp;ldquo;almost certainly overvalued,&amp;rdquo; leading to the conclusion that investors in these portfolios are &amp;ldquo;taking a huge risk.&amp;rdquo; He notes that investors in balanced portfolios starting in 1966, who rebalanced once a year, lost almost two-thirds of their purchasing power over the next 15 years. Even more troubling, if these hypothetical investors withdrew 5 percent of their portfolios in the first year, and increased withdrawals each year to keep pace with inflation, within 18 years the portfolios were wiped out, decimated by poor returns from stocks and bonds.
