The munificence of their benefactor has meant that the collection is wonderfully rich &amp;ndash; but there&amp;rsquo;s not enough money to spend on its display. Upstairs the house is looking tired and needs a new carpet and a fresh coat of paint.

Looks like; the Republican party is seating on the cliff and few unorganized, immature and empty headed kids are pushing it in to the deep canyon. I read the writing on the wall &amp;#8220;GOP is RIP here&amp;#8221;.
