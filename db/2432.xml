They had lots of heady dudes. We already can read what they said. At least the ones that lived long enough to publish. But what if most of the really smart ones started getting complex systems mostly figured out, then got confronted by that evil bitch Medusa and said something like &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t like your hair&amp;#8221; and BAM &amp;#8211; turned to stone.

At the time, SeaWorld claimed that the whale had pulled her underwater by her pony tail, perhaps mistaking it for a fish, but Cowperthwaite has unearthed eyewitnesses who remember the incident very differently. Tilikum&amp;rsquo;s behaviour, the film suggests, is no accident: behavioural experts describe the orca brain&amp;rsquo;s advanced capacity for emotion, while former trainers reveal the stories spun by SeaWorld to convince its visitors that the whales enjoy their work. Cowperthwaite has also dredged up camcorder clips of further whale attacks on trainers, and in this way a coldly compelling case is built.
