    <body>Where do you come from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/best-muscle-building-foods-bodybuilding-b1c8.pdf#military&quot;&gt;natural muscle building foods list&lt;/a&gt;  The MVP-caliber player who hit 39 homers and stole 40 bases in 2011 has rarely shown top form since undergoingÂ offseason surgery to repair the labrum of his left (non-throwing) shoulder. Unsurprisingly, he got off to a slow start in 2013, hitting just .251/.305/.335 with two homers through May 29, when he strained his right hamstring. He spent 26 days on the DL, and was just starting to heat up â homering on back-to-back days on July 3-4 â when he aggravated the acromioclavicular joint of his left shoulder in his first plate appearance on July 5. After receiving a cortisone shot, he was placed on the DL in a retroactive move on July 8.
