Democrats have filibustered but NEVER to the level of obstruction the GOP has the past 4 1/2 years and democrats did NOT filibuster every piece of legislation and nominee.

That&apos;s why it&apos;s perfectly fine for parents to spend a few months fretting over the potential drawbacks of choosing a child&apos;s name.
