The dike is managed to contain lake levels up to 15.5 feet. Above this height, the Corps has determined that the weight of the water begins to pose a significant risk to the dike&apos;s structural integrity. When heavy rains and runoff cause the lake to rise beyond this capacity the Corps conducts a managed release of water to return it to a safe level. These were the conditions this summer which required the release of water from the lake.

I&amp;#8217;m not religious these days, but I&amp;#8217;m still glad that the pope is making at least small strides in this direction. I hope the church starts stressing similar things among the laity. Either (A) start walking the walk if you talk the talk, or (B) stop talking the talk. Either option is better than gross hypocrisy.

However she did coauthor a study that linked an outbreak of disease among sea otters off the coast of California to runoff water that was contaminated with cat feces.
