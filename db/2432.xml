However, most experts estimate that the number is around 32 million. Studies in the past and prevalent notions contend that women are twice as vulnerable as men to depression. However the scale used to measure depression is subject to a lot of debate. Men are often shy to admit their depressed state of mind to defend their masculinity. Often men have different ways to express something than women. This can be understood by the way men express their displeasure- anger, violence and self destruction while women show it by expressions like crying or sadness.
