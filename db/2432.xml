    <body>Not in at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/sagehealth-7684.pdf&quot;&gt;sage.health&lt;/a&gt;  I think they deserve a say in Microsoft&amp;#8217;s future CEO. But I have questioned Microsoft&amp;#8217;s hardware endeavor&amp;#8217;s because one thing the Windows side of computing is NOT lacking its companies to make products. Its a far cry from Apple who makes its own hardware exclusively. I do not think Microsoft ever wants to take that step and be a sole hardware maker for its products. I actually think Apple would do a great service to its expansion to allow for other hardware makers to make some Mac&amp;#8217;s and run OS X on other hardware. That would expand Apple&amp;#8217;s ecosystem. Microsoft has a huge ecosystem of hardware partners. It just needs to supply them faster with the software and operating systems they can use to make competitive products.
