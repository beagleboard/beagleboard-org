    <body>Pleased to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/stmap_58840.html?viagra.finpecia.furacin&quot;&gt;surgicalmedsupplies.com&lt;/a&gt;  Girardi is still deliberating after the Yankees made him an offer â one termed by a source last week as âvery generousâ â to continue as manager. He has said all along that he wanted to have his future sorted out quickly once the season ended, but the Yankees appear content to wait as long as they must before he comes to a decision.
