    <body>Are you a student? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/ekospharmacombr-bac9.pdf&quot;&gt;ekospharma.com.br&lt;/a&gt;  Ok for me, noone is ever going to replace or has been as good as David Tennant as the doctor and I have watched them all! I did kind of like Matt Smith&apos;s originality though. First impressions of the new Doctor are not very favourable but I suppose we should give him the chance. Personally his face as a Time Lord just doesn&apos;t fit into the role as I perceive it and I don&apos;t fancy watching him.....
