    <body>I&apos;d like , please &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?cafergot.lamictal.diamox.viagra&quot;&gt;ofloxacin ear drops pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;  The world&amp;rsquo;s 15 species of cranes are widely but unevenly distributed with only five in the southern hemisphere; 10 species inhabit Eurasia and North America, where they perform lengthy migrations. At one time the sight of migrant cranes on genuine passage to and from unknown territories seemed to echo larger human mysteries. In Asia, the birds became a symbol of the ultimate journey. They were said to carry the souls of the departed on their ascent to heaven. Yet alongside these transcendent notions, cranes retain a genuine capacity to illuminate some of the most important political issues of our age. There is no finer example than the story &amp;ndash; one is almost tempted to call it the parable &amp;ndash; of whooping cranes in North America. At one time this magnificent species was hounded towards extinction until, by the 1940s, the world population stood at 29 birds. Today, the concerted efforts to save it are still ongoing and it has become a central emblem for all North American conservation.
