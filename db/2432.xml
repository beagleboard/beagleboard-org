    <body>I love this site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/dc-clinic-amsterdam-e0f9.pdf#dollars&quot;&gt;dc clinical webinars&lt;/a&gt;  I consulted with my old friend Taylor Stoermer, a historian at Colonial Williamsburg, about what the political landscape looked like back when the founders were framing our democratic republic. &quot;After the American Revolution, after the Constitution, when you&apos;re talking about the kind of people who are a part of the political community, you&apos;re talking about white male property owners,&quot; he says, continuing, &quot;You&apos;re talking about white, male Protestants.
