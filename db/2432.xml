Her body was found naked and malnourished and showed signs of possible sex abuse. Retired Det. Jerry Giorgio, who worked the case from the beginning, said their theory was she was dumped there by the people who were supposed to be caring for her. They abused her and eventually suffocated her.

Most lakes in the Bemidji area rely almost entirely on natural reproduction so anything that attacks the ability of the lakes to be self-sustaining is serious business.
