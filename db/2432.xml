    <body>Could I have , please? &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/kop-steroiderpro-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;solacemedllc.com&lt;/a&gt;  An eagle-eyed photographer is sharing his pictures of a hawk hanging out at Brooklyn&amp;#146;s Fulton Mall. The photographer, who gave only his first name, Jeremy, told AnimalNewYork.com that the bird seemed calm and stayed outside the shopping center for about 10 minutes, not even moving as kids and their parents stopped to take a look. &apos;(He) only flew away when a dog got too close to him &amp;#151; at which point everyone started yelling at the dog owner,&apos; he told the website. &apos;People love hawks, as it turns out.&apos;
