    <body>Can I use your phone? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/cialis-best-dosage-0bae.pdf#sterility&quot;&gt;cialis originale lilly&lt;/a&gt;  May 15, 2013 Letterman: &amp;#8220;The president held a press conference Monday and the reporters were on him like a pack of wild dogs. He did pretty well&amp;#8212;you know because he&amp;#8217;s been listening to their conversations, so he knew exactly what was going to happen.&amp;#8221;

Oh wait, that&amp;#8217;s not sexy or divisive enough to take the heat off of an incompetent occupant in the white house or bafoons in both the republitard and democrap parties. That&amp;#8217;s right, sorry&amp;#8230;. my bad.

A free public education is our right. I donât understand why weâd be charged for it.

I have always said it is very very bad. And guess what, MA is broke because of that healthcare law. It went into place in 2006 and they were broke as of 2009. They put 1.1 billion in in 2008 and 1.3 billion in in 2009. MA is a small state and it took them 3 years to go broke. How long will it take this country 5 maybe 10. If were lucky. Oh, btw 53 % of Americans DO NOT WANT THIS LAW. Poll taken in July.
