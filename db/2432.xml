Despite exhaustive efforts over the years, the international community has yet to agree on a practical solution to the statelessness that has been Somalia&amp;#x2019;s lot since the collapse of the last government there more than two decades ago. And, as the resurgence of a smaller but more radicalized, operationally sophisticated and lethal Shabab &amp;#x2013; underscored by the Kenyan shopping mall attack and the U.S. attempt to seize one of its leaders in Barawe, Somalia &amp;#x2013; makes it clear that self-congratulatory proclamations by U.S. and European leaders about the successes of the current Somali government are little more than wishful thinking. No campaign against the pirates at sea or against the Shabab can be sustainable unless the rule of law is reestablished on land.
