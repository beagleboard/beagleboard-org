And now you wonder if maybe Joe Girardi, seeing the same thing, wonât also follow his fellow â96, â98, â99 ring-bearers out the door? Is Girardi â who will almost surely get a goodly share of Manager of the Year votes even if he isnât able to complete a miracle run to the playoffs with this rag-tag, beaten up Yankee team â prepared to be Johnny Keane circa 1965? In recent days, Girardi has been evasive whenever questions about his Yankee future have been broached. As a free agent, heâs certainly going to have options, not the least of which could be his old hometown team, the Cubs. Unlike the Yankees, the Cubs under Theo Epstein have been quietly assembling a top-rated group of young players and prospects through the draft (shortstop Javier Baez, outfielder Albert Almora, righthander Kris Bryant), trades (first baseman Anthony Rizzo, third baseman Mike Olt) and international signings (Cuban outfielder Jorge Soler). Dare we say the lovable losers of Wrigley Field look to have a brighter future than the Yankees right now?

The company has been beefing up its Local Express service, which offers same-day delivery in select markets, including Baltimore, Boston, New York City and Chicago.
