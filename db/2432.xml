The former &quot;High School Musical&quot; co-stars and longtime pals saluted the camera as they posed for a fun Memorial Day shot on Instagram May 27, 2013. While Tisdale rocked a striped pink and white bikini, Hudgens kept it boho chic in a shawl. &quot;BBQ at my house celebrating #memorialday @vanessahudgens,&quot; Tisdale wrote.

It&amp;#039;s certainly consistent with what we expect from global warming, but we also need to understand better the natural variation that occurs in the system on perhaps decadal timescales. Cryosat can begin to help us do that as well.&quot;

The 2003 US invasion was based on the lies, idiocy, and treason of the Bush regime, and the Obama regime used its lies, idiocy, and treason to try and remain in Iraq. We killed 4,500 US troops and wounded 33,000 more, many with their arms and legs blown off. Welcome to wars with explosives! Now, the Iraqis are training themselves to be cannon fodder in Syria, and the Syrian Uncivil War, if any of them survive, will make them better cannon fodder in their own, or someone else&amp;#8217;s, uncivil war. Training and experience in unconventional wars is a gift that can keep on giving for many years.
