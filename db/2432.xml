I try to give a lot of information in the annual report to enable our shareholders to make a reasonable estimate of what intrinsic value is. If you buy Berkshire at or below its intrinsic business value, I think you&apos;ll do reasonably well over time because I think the money we reinvest will be compounded fairly intelligently.

Finally, the RICS and the market overall may well find that fears of over-heating will quickly dispel once the era of ultra-low interest rates comes to an end â and that looks likely to come sooner than Bank governor Mark Carneyâs âforward guidanceâ currently suggests. Mortgage borrowers today would do well to bear this in mind: todayâs rock-bottom lending rates are not going to last forever.
