    <body>Did you go to university? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/bodymedcenter-aadorfch-0a7b.pdf&quot;&gt;medclick.com.br&lt;/a&gt;  Buffett also advised students to stick with companies and industries that they know. &quot;The most important thing is deciding what industries you can be right about,&quot; he said. Bill Gates couldn&apos;t convince him about computers, he said, but he did understand that people would continue to chew gum and drink soft drinks. &quot;I&apos;ll stick with chewing gum,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible mistake to think you have to have an opinion on everything.&quot;
