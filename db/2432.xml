    <body>Could you give me some smaller notes? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/ballistic-labs-night-ops-e3c4.pdf#society&quot;&gt;ballistic labs wmd&lt;/a&gt;  I was very fond of the old skinny skis and for some time resisted switching to carvers. I figured if you could ski well enough on the old skis you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to change. Just to prove my point, I won a few races with friends who had switched to carving skis. But in the end I reluctantly succumbed and do find them better all-terrain skis especially in powder, slush and spring snow &amp;ndash; being that much shorter they are easier to turn. I tend to rent these days as I like to try the latest models.
