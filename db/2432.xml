    <body>I really like swimming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/stromedcomau-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;christinashealthychoices.com&lt;/a&gt;  Lienâs wife issued a statement on Thursday that should have been wholly unnecessary in light of a video showing how he was trapped and fled, how his car was set upon during the chase, and how motorcyclists smashed at his windows when the SUV came to a stop. After the video stopped, Lien was dragged from his vehicle and assaulted.
