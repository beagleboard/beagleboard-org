Suppose that instead of featuring navigational aids, these things instead featured some kind of banner ad. In order to read any story on a site, you&amp;#8217;d need to be constantly staring at a page with a sticky unit saying &amp;#8220;Drink Coca-Cola&amp;#8221; at the top. No editor would countenance such a thing: annoying ads are one thing, but they all at least feature a little &amp;#8220;x&amp;#8221; which you can click on to make them go away.

Besides Mursi, the Brotherhood&apos;s three top leaders are also in jail, together with the head of its political party. It is the toughest crackdown in decades on a group that has been repressed by successive military governments.

He says far too many new investors find themselves looking for the next hot thing. &quot;Investors need to understand that by the time they recognize a trend, the easy money has been made. It&apos;s much better to look at proven long-term strategies and stick with them,&quot; DeShurko says.
