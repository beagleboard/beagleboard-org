Since the oceanic ecosystems are very complex, she explains, we still have only a vague idea about the future impact of overfishing and ocean acidification, for instance, especially if we do not know which species occur where. What initial analyses of MAREDAT do show is that there are far more organisms in the deep sea than has been assumed so far. In addition, it seems that across the world&apos;s oceans, zooplankton have at least as much biomass as phytoplankton. &quot;This is surprising, since it is usually just the other way round in the terrestrial systems, where there are more plants than animals,&quot; says Meike Vogt. Her group also uses MAREDAT to form fundamental hypotheses about ecological diversity and to verify their models with the newly obtained data.

Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Berlin is &quot;prepared to make a technical or financial contribution to the destruction of chemical weapons from Syria.&quot; He didn&apos;t elaborate, but officials say Germany has helped destroy chemical weapons in Libya and elsewhere in the past.
