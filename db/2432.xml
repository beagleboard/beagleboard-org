    <body>I quite like cooking &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/stmap_69bc0.html?viagra.azelastine.kytril.vicerex&quot;&gt;pharmaphenix&lt;/a&gt;  Another problem with claims in the UK is that often people are genuinely hurt, but the cause may not have been whiplash. Advertising has a large role to play here. It&apos;s difficult to go 10 minutes through daytime television on any commercial channel (I&apos;m told) without being affronted by a Z-list celebrity bleating &quot;have you been injured in a car accident or at work?&quot;, or similar.

Among their victims were girls as young as 11, several of whom were in the care of social services. &quot;If you come from a background where your family structures are not as strong, it&apos;s human instinct to want to belong. When you talk to a lot of these girls, what they say is they want to be part of something because they&apos;re socially excluded in other ways. With some of the grooming cases, that&apos;s when men take advantage of these girls.&quot;
