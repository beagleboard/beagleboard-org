    <body>What sort of music do you listen to? &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/augmentin-hind-7ef0.pdf&quot;&gt;augmentin fiyatlar&lt;/a&gt;  Investors in private-label MBS have experienced hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. Let&apos;s look, for instance, at JPMorgan&apos;s description of the fate of mortgage-backed securities sold by the bank and its predecessors Bear and WaMu. According to JPMorgan&apos;s 2012 annual report, the three entities sold a combined $450 billion in MBS to private investors (as opposed to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) between 2005 and 2008. More than a quarter of the original face value of the securities, or $118 billion of that $450 billion, has been liquidated, with investors suffering average losses of more than 60 percent on liquidated underlying loans. By my math, that&apos;s about $71 billion in losses for private-label JPM, Bear and WaMu MBS trusts as of the filing of the bank&apos;s annual report last December - with more likely, since the report also disclosed that $39 billion in underlying mortgage loans were at least 60 days overdue.
