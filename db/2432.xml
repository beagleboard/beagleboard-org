The mainframe computer companies that delved into making PC&amp;#8217;s were even worse than dell as far as going deeply proprietary without good reason. Remember how the Microchannel Bus from IBM left behind the PC compatible standard minus IBM made PC&amp;#8217;s.

Etching and polishing of the material with chalcogens can change the material&apos;s composition, due to the motion of the tellurium atoms,&quot; explained Zhou.

The measure must now be approved by the Republican-controlled House where it is expected to encounter rough going. The House could vote on a bill in an unusual Saturday or Sunday session.
