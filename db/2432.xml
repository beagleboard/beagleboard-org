    <body>Thanks for calling &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?staytal.atorvastatin.levitra.rosuvastatin&quot;&gt;de.nutrend-supplements.com&lt;/a&gt;  Thatâs a great question, and itâs one we hear every year. And I think thereâs a couple ways to answer that question. Iâll start by saying, the flu vaccine cannot give you the flu. The vaccine includes either a killed version of the virus, or a component thatâs been altered in a way such that itâs not infectious. Some of the new vaccines have just a small component of the virus, one single protein, and not the virus at all, so they cannot be infectious. Thereâs one vaccine formulation thatâs brand new this year, thatâs a purified protein vaccine, and it contains a small part of the influenza virus, just a protein essentially, and that helps provide immunity from influenza. So, itâs non-infectious. It cannot give you influenza, and in fact, none of the vaccines can give you influenza.
