I graduated from the University of Michigan Business and Law schools and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. I started my career at Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed, a corporate law firm. After switching to journalism, I covered the corporate scandals at WorldCom and Adelphia, Eliot Spitzer, the SEC, and the Supreme Court as a reporter for the New York Law Journal. I have also written for American Lawyer Magazine and Legal Affairs Magazine, and authored Children of Armenia: A Forgotten Genocide and the Century-Long Struggle for Justice (Simon &amp; Schuster).
