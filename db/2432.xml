At the age of 13, few are very active. Some 85% of girls and 73% of boys say they do not do even an hour&apos;s physical activity a day, which is the recommended minimum. Nearly three-quarters of 13-year-olds (68% of girls and 74% of boys) say they watch at least two hours of TV on a week day, leaving less time for sport and physical activity. Around a quarter of children (23% of boys and 25% of girls) spend at least six hours sitting down on Saturday and Sunday.
