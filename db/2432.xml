    <body>This site is crazy :) &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/stmap_e52c0.html?levitra.tadapox.symmetrel.norfloxacin&quot;&gt;phoenix pharma se mannheim&lt;/a&gt;  Kia released a statement: Kia Motors America places a priority on vehicle safety, and all Kia vehicles sold in the United States meet or exceed all federal motor vehicle safety standards. Maximizing occupant protection is complex and involves a diverse range of variables, and Kia is proud of its strong safety record and the integrity of its products. The newly initiated &quot;small overlap&quot; crash test conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) goes well beyond federal requirements and is only one of the many tests used to evaluate vehicles. The IIHS has recognized numerous Kia vehicles as &quot;Top Safety Picks,&quot; including the 2013 Soul. Additionally, the 2013 Soul and 2014 Forte have received five-star safety ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for side impact protection. Kia will carefully evaluate the results of the new IIHS test procedure, along with the results of all other tests, as part of its commitment to continuous improvement in occupant protection.
