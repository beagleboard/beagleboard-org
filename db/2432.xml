Scotland will vote on the issue in a referendum to be held on 18 September 2014. He said few politicians, let alone voters, had fully considered the implications of such a move. âNobody is talking about what kind of a Scotland we want after independence,â he said. âPeople in England havenât really come to terms with what it would mean. It would mean losing Trident.â

Navratilova pointed out on Saturday that Djokovic has trouble starting matches that begin too early in the day, because heâs known as someone who canât fall asleep until 3 a.m. That worked against him with Wawrinka. It wonât be a problem on Monday, when the match will start at a very reasonable 5 p.m.

In particular Murray served as well as he has everdone, hitting 21 aces â to Federerâs three - and mixing power withclever variations of direction and spin. Federer, meanwhile,frequently struggled on his own serve thanks to the quality ofMurrayâs returns.

But not in chronological order, jumping between time periods as she spends time under government experimentation, as a rising star in the CIA and on the run from the law. The temporal disorder makes sense in theory; the trajectory of Jodie&amp;rsquo;s life means that events unfolding concurrently would lead to a pacing issue. However, in practice the narrative jumps around so violently and frequently between time periods that the story struggles to gain a foothold. It lacks a singular narrative thread to tie the scenes together, leading to a disparate collection of vignettes. Top secret government labs, CIA training montages, teenage parties, homelessness, snowball fights, makeshift midwifery (with the most staggeringly unrealistic depiction of birth I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen), spiritual war in the Navajo desert, civil war in Somalia.
