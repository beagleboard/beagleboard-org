    <body>Are you a student? &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/cheap-naproxen-uk-9392.pdf#protect&quot;&gt;para que sirve el naproxeno 500 mg&lt;/a&gt;  While this would be hard to do because of the highly local and political nature of education policy, if it were done, it would change the event from yet another nice gathering to a powerful engine for change. If it were up to me, these would be my three calls to action: 1. Call on Congress to get back to work and move the myriad education spending and policy reauthorization bills under consideration; 2. Ask Governors to overhaul their teacher training schools so that we are producing more high-quality teachers; and 3. Urge the next mayor of New York City to treat the city&amp;rsquo;s excellent charter schools as partners not pariahs.Â What would yours be?
