Part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Ocean Beach offers 3.5 miles of sand running along the edge of Golden Gate Park, perfect for flying kites or watching shorebirds, such as the threatened snowy plover. The beach remains shrouded in fog for much of the late spring and summer, but fall often brings with it warmer, sunnier days. Even when the sunâs shining, however, the waters offshore remain remarkably cold with dangerous currents and massive waves that are not to be trifled with unless youâre an experienced surfer. Instead, youâre better off spending time with friends around a bonfire at one of the newly installed fire rings.

But that shouldnât be a problem in New York, according to Carmelo Anthony, who openly dished on the pecking order of who gets the blame when things go wrong for the Knicks. In short, Bargnani should feel at home in New York because only one man assumes the blame here. And that man, according to Anthony, is Carmelo Anthony, leaving Bargnani to play free and loose, something he didnât always do in Toronto.
