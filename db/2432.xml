    <body>I study here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/thehealthshoppenet-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;buymedsonline.net&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;When I had said some politicians were given money, it was not meant for their personal purpose or political purpose. It was not for lining their pockets or for bribe. If somebody says that any minister was given a bribe, it is totally wrong. It was meant solely for stability, to win hearts and minds of people, to wean people away from separatist activities under the overall umbrella of sadbhavna (harmony),&quot; the paper quoted him as saying.
