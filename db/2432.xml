Paul Doyle, the agent for the two sprinters, said they worked in conjunction with WADA on the raid after becoming suspicious that Christopher Xuereb, their newly hired trainer, might have given them supplements laced with a banned substance. Doyle also said that Powell and Simpson were aware of the impending raid, but Xuereb was kept out of the loop.

Christine and John McVie&amp;rsquo;s marriage had broken down irreparably, to the point where they couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk to each other, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks had a tempestuous relationship, and even the marriage of the band&amp;rsquo;s rock, Mick Fleetwood, was disintegrating. Raw emotions fed the lyrics, yet the result was hugely catchy pop and, with over 40 million sold, Rumours&amp;rsquo; remains possibly the best known break-up album ever.
