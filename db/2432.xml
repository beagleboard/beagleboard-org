    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/medical-couriers-melbourne-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;medical couriers delivery service&lt;/a&gt;  Setting the same time limit for men and women was &amp;#8220;unrealistic&amp;#8221;, said Professor Jackson. In addition, different aspects of the test &amp;#8211; especially the gate weave and body drag &amp;#8211; discriminated against the female figure. Women found it harder to negotiate the slalom because of their wider hips. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the way we were created, it&amp;#8217;s a beautiful thing,&amp;#8221; said Professor Jackson. &amp;#8220;The gates were not wide enough so men with snake hips could weave through quite easily. Females were wobbling and moving around, catching the gate, going back and having to do it again.&amp;#8221;
