    <body>This site is crazy :) &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/no3-chrome-g4-83f5.pdf&quot;&gt;no3 chrome g4&lt;/a&gt;  Davis went 0-for-2 with runners in scoring position. âBoth of them (those at-bats) were frustrating,â Davis said. âObviously, if I knew he was going to throw me a fastball (on 0-and-2) instead of a nasty breaking ball that I would have had to stay back on, I probably would have had a better swing at it.
