    <body>Could I have a statement, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/sutton-out-of-hours-pharmacy-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;north shore after hours pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  âI saw what he said, and he said I should be at the course nine to five,â McIlroy said Wednesday on the eve of the British Open at Muirfield. âI actually was on the range at 6:15, and got out of the gym at 6:15, actually a 12-hour day compared to his eight-hour day. It is what it is, and Nick should know how hard this game is at times. And heâs been in our position before. And he should know how much work that we all do put into it.â
