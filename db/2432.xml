If you&apos;ve never seen Twister on a gigantic screen with Dolby, you have never seen it. This year&apos;s devastation in the American Midwest is a tragic reminder of the catastrophic real-life toll of tornados, but Twister tamed the whirlwind for family-friendly entertainment &amp;ndash; the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) rated it PG-13 &quot;for intense depiction of very bad weather.&quot;
