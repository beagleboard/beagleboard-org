But what it does do, it does so consistently well, and so cheaply, that it&amp;#39;s quickly became a primary part of my media-watching routine. Chromecast, a little USB-stick-sized device, streams Netflix, YouTube and other sites to your TV. (But wait a second, aren&amp;#39;t Netflix and YouTube also websites? Yes, but there&amp;#39;s a technical distinction we&amp;#39;ll get to in a minute.) Also, Chromecast is fast, unbelievably easy to set up, and pretty much foolproof to use. And it&amp;#39;s Â£30, which makes it one of the best values in tech, ever. Combine all that and it&amp;#39;s irresistible. In the five days I&amp;#39;ve had it, Chromecast has become my go-to way for streaming shows to my TV. It&amp;#39;s expected to hit shops in the UK before Christmas.
