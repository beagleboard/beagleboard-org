    <body>I&apos;m a partner in  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/catuaba-bark-dosage-for-women-e3c4.pdf#hatch&quot;&gt;catuaba bark dosage for women&lt;/a&gt;  This act is such a farse. They claimed you would be able to keep your current insurance or get on the Market. Relative legislation required private insurances to drop coverages, for example I went from a $250 deductable to a $4000 deductable- for the cost of $3000 annually. Knowing that I was below the rule of 4 x Poverty Rate, I was not bothered- just figured I would switch to the Market. I found out this past week that because I have insurance through work, I cannot get on the Market- even though I would qualify for maximum discounts. This Act is just a great big scam to make the Federal Government and Insurance Companies alot more money, at the expence of the working poor.
