    <body>I&apos;d like to send this letter by  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bombeirodf.com.br/stmap_50f80.html?procalis.viagra.minomycin&quot;&gt;longjax studies&lt;/a&gt;  During public hearings, many fans told city officials that it was time for the ballpark to change. They said if the team was to continue to attract fans, particularly younger ones, it had to include the Jumbotron and other amenities that are common in every other Major League stadium. The back-and-forth became so heated that at one point, the team&apos;s chairman, Tom Ricketts, floated the idea of moving the team to another location where it could get the amenities it needs to compete with other teams.
