    <body>Will I be paid weekly or monthly? &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/healthydiet24com-69bc.pdf#weigh&quot;&gt;cz.royalpharms.net&lt;/a&gt;  For example, when they were young, they wanted the best schools, with busing, and the best parks, etc. for their children. They then elected representatives who promised them they&apos;d deliver on those demands--regardless of the costs. When they were young and working, it was easier to pay for that. Now that their kids are out of schools, they&apos;re always whining about having to pay high school taxes for OTHER people&apos;s children. Nevertheless, the young are paying these retired types for their Medicare and drug coverages, but they don&apos;t see that, because they &quot;deserve&quot; what they worked for.
