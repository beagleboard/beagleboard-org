He recovered and got Ronny Cedeno on an 85-mph slider for his ninth strikeout of the night. That, however, was already his 78th pitch. In the fifth, with his pitch count climbing, Wheeler needed the help from fellow rookie Juan Lagares to get out of another bases-loaded situation. After getting Chase Headley to strike out looking for the second out of that inning, Lagares threw out Ross at the plate for his 10th major-league assist to end the fifth.
