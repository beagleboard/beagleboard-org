    <body>This site is crazy :) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?suprax.moxifloxacin.viagra&quot;&gt;venlafaxine hcl 150 mg 24hr sa cap&lt;/a&gt;  I don&amp;#8217;t remember that being true of Pope Paul VI, who preceded John Paul, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t true of Benedict, who followed him, but it is true of Francis. This week he had words on homosexuality, and they made big news. In part this was surprising and in part not. What the pope told reporters was nothing Catholics wouldn&amp;#8217;t say and haven&amp;#8217;t said in common conversation. Asked about his views on priests who are homosexual and celibate, Francis responded, &amp;#8220;If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?&amp;#8221;
