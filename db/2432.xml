    <body>We used to work together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/ample-meal-review-6ae3.pdf#fright&quot;&gt;sample meal plans ketosis diet&lt;/a&gt;  I sat on the floor. I hadn&amp;#8217;t done so much floor-sitting since middle school, and my mind wandered. In 1998, I was fourteen, and had begun to take long walks at night. Passing down Cole Street and Irving Street and through the weft of avenues out to the park, I used to watch the urban landscape changing: five-and-dimes would become food shops; restaurants and caf√©s stood where bakeries and fabric stores had been. By night, candles flickered on the tables of big-windowed wine bars. Men in bright sneakers and women in boots spilled into the fog. A swell of humming conversation, wine, perfume, and roasting garlic trailed them through the open doors. If promises were made to those of us who started to grow up then, I thought, they came from the glow and freedom of those boom-time nights.
