    <body>I&apos;m not working at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/archymedicalcom-69bc.pdf&quot;&gt;33-99.com&lt;/a&gt;  The third umpire spends about 80&amp;thinsp;&amp;thinsp;per cent of his time watching television images but also has to monitor over-rates, logo infringements and communications between officials and the television broadcaster. Last week in Sri Lanka, Rod Tucker, the Australian umpire, was ill and missed a match between Sri Lanka and South Africa but rather than use the local umpire to fill in as third official, he was instead asked to umpire on the field such is the specialist nature of the TV job and the amount of training required.
