Consider modeling optimism to your kids by expressing gratitude for daily happenings at the dinner table, he suggests.

That sort of flexibility helped Marlin win a job this year from a longtime German supplier to a U.S. auto-parts factory. The order was for baskets that are more like trays, about the size of the ones in a cafeteria, but weighing more than 10 pounds and made of stainless steel, with thick wire props in the middle. The baskets hold heavy auto parts so they can be washed, treated, and presented to robots for assembly. &quot;Because you&apos;re staging parts for the robots, the parts have to be in exactly the right place,&quot; says Greenblatt--within three-thousandths of an inch in all three dimensions. The baskets, which will hold parts that go into Chrysler cars, cost $200 apiece. And the supplier needed 1,000 of them--a $200,000 order. &quot;The German vendor had made this style of product for them for over 20 years,&quot; says Greenblatt, &quot;and quoted them four months to make the new version.&quot; Marlin said it could do the job in four weeks. And it delivered. &quot;If a car company doing a model-year changeover can get the assembly line going faster, the value of that extra three months of production is enormous,&quot; says Greenblatt. &quot;The baskets are paid for in a couple hours.&quot;
