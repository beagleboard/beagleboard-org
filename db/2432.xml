    <body>I&apos;m a partner in  &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/stmap_92e20.html?ciplox.sildenafil.herbolax.levitra&quot;&gt;purchase probido&lt;/a&gt;  From the beginning their relationship was very open. &amp;lsquo;They came to our house. They had lunch with the children. That was wonderful.&amp;rsquo; During the pregnancy the Petersons were sent the ultrasound pictures via email, which they shared on Facebook. The birth mother videoed her baby opening gifts the Petersons had sent. Annabel felt a surge of recognition when she set eyes on her biological son. &amp;lsquo;He looks like my brother,&amp;rsquo; she says. &amp;lsquo;I lost him in 1995 in a car accident. He has a lot of his traits &amp;ndash; his smile. His feet and his eyelashes are like mine. I see him as a distant cousin with whom I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a relationship for ever &amp;ndash; but I don&amp;rsquo;t see him as my child.When my husband and I are gone my kids are going to have an extended family to love them, somewhere to spend Thanksgiving together. How awesome is that? Of course when he was born I cried &amp;ndash; as much for joy as for loss. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give him his opportunity to live. Knowing that he has that opportunity, it&amp;rsquo;s so much greater than my pain.&amp;rsquo;
