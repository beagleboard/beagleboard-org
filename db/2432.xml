I do two things here to make it super easy (I rarely open my statements either) &amp;#8211; first, I use Mint to keep track of all of my spending, it will send alerts even if your bank won&amp;#8217;t, and it&amp;#8217;s also a handy way of seeing your entire financial picture in one place. Second, I have my bank alerts set up to not just alert me on specific transactions, but to send me a daily email summary of ALL account activity. Perhaps one or both of these things would have alerted you to the strange activity sooner rather than later.

Headlines has put Laura in touch with other families living with similar conditions. The grant will fund a childrenâs book introducing the procedures children will be undergoing throughout their treatment. Laura says: âJeans for Genes Day is so important.

Iâd like to break down the stigma that exists around people who look a bit different.â
