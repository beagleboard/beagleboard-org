Their claim &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;verified by two independent and separate sources,&amp;rdquo; they say &amp;ndash; is that there&amp;rsquo;s a mass of unseen Salinger writings set to be published &amp;ldquo;in irregular instalments starting between 2015 and 2020&amp;rdquo;.

(Thomas Beller, the author of a forthcoming biography, also got the cold shoulder.)
