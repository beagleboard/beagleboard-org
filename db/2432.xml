    <body>Whereabouts are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/pharmaconcepcom-a6a4.pdf&quot;&gt;formedical.com.br&lt;/a&gt;  Reese Witherspoon may not be as squeaky-clean as she&apos;s perceived! The Oscar-winning actress surprised onlookers as she celebrated the July 4th holiday in Malibu with new husband Jim Toth and her two children Ava, 11, and Deacon, 7. While hanging out with her brood on the beach, Witherspoon&apos;s button-down top occasionally shifted, revealing what appears to be a large tattoo across her stomach. Though it&apos;s difficult to make out what exactly is inked on the famous actress&apos; belly, some believe the design is of two birds joined around a blue star tattoo that Witherspoon has sported for years.
