The singer was pulled over by Los Angeles County Sheriff&apos;s Department officers for a traffic violation, according to the gossip site. Cops smelled alcohol when they approached his vehicle and administered several field sobriety tests, which the singer reportedly performed poorly. Springfield was then arrested on suspicion of DUI and booked in a nearby jail. He was later released on $5,000 bail. Law enforcement sources told TMZ that Springfields blood alcohol content measured at .10 and .08. The legal limit in California is .08.

But since the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 there&amp;rsquo;s been an ongoing effort to draft treaties, establish jurisdiction and evolve a body of space law.

Apple captured a hardware sweet spot amidst disruptive technological changes to music downloading, Google brought in advertising to pay for email services, Amazon took a loss in its play to profit big time from changing consumer preferences, and WalMart became a retail hegemon by capturing the sweet spot created by a societal commitment to underwrite the true costs of trucking and driving. Despite their vastly different business models, each of these winners showed a common focus on capturing value from activities that were cheap or free elsewhere in the chain. In Acceleration Group&apos;s work with innovators, we see that these are not just stand-out cases, but rather powerful examples of strategy these innovators apply productively in their own sectors. Whether you have your own business, are an investor in an innovative venture, or are a corporate manager seeking to take advantage of disruption, assessing risks and opportunities from this point of view can be critical. The changes that will lead to the next big wins in your industry are already taking shape. Can you identify the source of the next big shift, and where the dangling value will be?
