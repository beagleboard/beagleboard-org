When a bank has operations across the globe, either the authorities in one country need the power to swoop in and restructure the whole operation. Or the authorities in several countries have to swoop in together in a coordinated fashion. Whatever happens, there has to be a legal regime that allows this to occur. This is not yet in place, although the G20 promised to act at its St Petersburg summit earlier this month.

The mainframe computer companies that delved into making PC&amp;#8217;s were even worse than dell as far as going deeply proprietary without good reason. Remember how the Microchannel Bus from IBM left behind the PC compatible standard minus IBM made PC&amp;#8217;s. Consumers if given a choice want standards for parts that fit the entire industry and facilitate price competition as well as constant upgradeable components.
