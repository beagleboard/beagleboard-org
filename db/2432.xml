Another in Australian waters moved 5,000 miles to the south Pacific in 17 days. Recent work suggests a mean speed of 34&amp;thinsp;mph but for almost a tenth of their journeys they travel at over 53&amp;thinsp;mph. One of the most striking aspects of the English-speaking world&amp;rsquo;s engagement with albatrosses is the absolute dominance of a single artistic representation. Indeed it is hard to think of another animal where one cultural image has so engaged and almost trapped our imaginations. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&amp;rsquo;s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, published in 1798, profoundly affects how the bird is perceived in popular culture but &amp;ndash; strangely &amp;ndash; it has also muddled our understanding of how albatrosses were viewed in the past. Even today it is a poem shrouded in confusion, perhaps partly because Coleridge steeped the bird in a powerful and highly refracted symbolism.

They demanded Madoff give them substantial raises in 2006, requesting part of it to be paid in diamonds so as not to leave a paper trail, Schwartz said.
