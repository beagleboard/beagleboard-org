Irving responded within hours in two tweets. &amp;#8220;I wish I knew &amp;#8216;someone in the know&amp;#8217; for all my facts, maybe I would go into journalism as well!!!&amp;#8221; Irving wrote. &amp;#8220;Rumors are rumors,&amp;#8221; he wrote in a subsequent tweet. The Cavs control Irving for three more seasons. &amp;#8230; Former Cavs assistant coach Joe Prunty is in Las Vegas for the summer league games. He was let go at the end of the season when Byron Scott was fired. Scott was in Las Vegas for the preliminary round games, too, but has already departed.
