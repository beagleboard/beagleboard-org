And when Gov. Andrew Cuomo acted on guns in New York back in March, got the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act written into law in his state, you know that Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the NRA and that organizationâs chief attack dog, went right after Cuomo the way he always goes after Bloomberg.

It would also help China Mobile appeal to the countryâs small niche of wealthier, iPhone-loving smartphone users. Such consumers seem to be Appleâs best chance in China, where even if the carrier helps cover the costs, customers will still have to lay out a lot of money upfront.

When the unruly teen refused, Mackintosh on a whim turned a pair of jeans into cut-offs. He sported them on the family field-trip in hopes of embarrassing his daughter and proving a point.

Major tech companies are required to retain certain data for varying lengths of time in case it is requested by law enforcement.
