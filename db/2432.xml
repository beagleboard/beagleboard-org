It is totally appropriate, however, to question whether the decisions made by Bain benefit American workers. Private companies like Bain are in business to make a profit for their investors, not to create or destroy jobs or to satisfy any other social goal. No one thinks other companies like Apple, Exxon, GE or Chase Bank is sitting around thinking about American jobs, right? So why should Bain? The question was begged by Mitt Romney himself, who said his experience would lead to more jobs, not by the Democrats.
