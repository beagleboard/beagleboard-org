I suspect not, because the data has shown signs of recovering but it also seems very likely that they will say something on forward guidance now, albeit delayed until August 7.

And, indeed, there were a couple of moments during the 16 hours for the first labour and 12 for the second when I might just have been missed. At one particularly tricky stage with number one (born in 1996), the midwife was holding my wife&amp;rsquo;s hand, and repeating a soothing mantra to her. It seemed to be doing the trick. &amp;ldquo;Now you take over,&amp;rdquo; she said, beckoning me in from the margins where I was occupying myself packing and unpacking and repacking the &amp;ldquo;hospital bag&amp;rdquo; (more like a furniture van, and full of things that we never used). So I stepped willingly, even excitedly, up to the plate, but had chanted the mantra no more than twice when I was promptly told in no uncertain terms by my wife to shut up.

Ivanka may have been born with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she and her siblings have not made headlines for being jerks; instead, they seem to have worked hard, gotten an education, found people they love and respect, and built families. They aren&amp;#8217;t in the headlines every day for all sorts of negative things, and they quietly help others as well. Ivana seems to have done a good job raising the children, and I guess Donald did, too. Can&amp;#8217;t wait to hear the name&amp;#8230;..
