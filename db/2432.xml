The Yanks stranded a dozen baserunners, like in the bad, old days. Alfonso Soriano (10-for-14 in three games with 14 RBI) was still socking the ball, but even with him the seams were showing a bit.

And Lord Powell, who wrote the speech, remains a convinced supporter of British EU membership. This is not going to change the minds of Tory Eurosceptics. But it does set a context for their constant invocation of Thatcher as their pathfinder.
