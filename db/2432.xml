He does have form. In terms of him as an England player, he was always likely to be a risk - he&amp;#039;s an X-factor player who can turn a game, but equally does give penalties away and lacks discipline. Put this alongside the shock defeat against Italy - you hope it doesn&amp;#039;t lead to a meltdown and England recover their poise.&quot;
