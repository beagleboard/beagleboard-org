It has done so through a massive campaign of overt and covert influence, one that has included the bankrolling of Shi&apos;ite militias, support for assorted Iraqi politicians and the insertion of intelligence and paramilitary assets on the territory of its western neighbor. But in recent years, Tehran&apos;s efforts have been hindered &amp;ndash; at least in part &amp;ndash; by the presence of American and allied troops, the Sunni &quot;awakening,&quot; and the Iraqi political system itself, which has tried to emphasize nationalism over religious identification.
