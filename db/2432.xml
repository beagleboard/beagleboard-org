But around mile 12, my IT band decided to make an appearance. The pain was immediate and intense but there was no way I was bowing out. With each passing mile the burning pinch would get a few degrees higher and the imaginary hand would dig a few inches further until part of my leg just went numb. But as long as I didn&apos;t stop, I could almost ignore it. Running lopsided and bent over nearly 90 degrees, I crossed that finish line, weeping openly as I did, more from the exhaustion than the pain, but who knows. It took me 4:37, which wasn&apos;t bad considering I ran half of it through piercing pain. But I paid for that relative success. I hobbled for two weeks and couldn&apos;t run for six months.

Numerous websites offer personalized vacation planning via the Internet with the help of these faceless customer service representatives. But there are still some complicated itineraries or lesser-known destinations where a skilled travel agent&apos;s help can be invaluable.

This is simply a form of protest. Instead of cutting expenses, they are putting all the cuts on the backs of government employees. The DOT did the same thing. Put the bulk of the cuts on the backs of air traffic controllers while they continued to spend $500M a years on consultants.
