    <body>In a meeting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/unitydrugsnl-6ae3.pdf&quot;&gt;genericons.com&lt;/a&gt;  Brad Pitt is 49-years-young! After years of growing out his blond shaggy locks, the Hollywood star has had the chop. Donning a sleeker side-parted hairdo, the hot dad has never looked better. Mr. Pitt was spotted making his way to the set of his new movie &quot;Fury&quot; where he plays a World War II soldier. This is definitely a new look for the heartthrob, but we welcome the change!

I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many people actually left Dubai in the crash, but the place is still almost 90 per cent foreign national, I was told. We didn&amp;rsquo;t meet one true native in a week of travelling around. We were helped, guided, driven and entertained by people from all over the Indian subcontinent, Scandinavia, Egypt, Romania, the Philippines, New Zealand and everywhere in between.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://accentresurfacing.com/karagandamed-emerkz-4110.pdf&quot;&gt;dolgellaudoctors.org&lt;/a&gt;  Wall Street&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Fabulous Fab&amp;#8221; is heading to trial today and the case brings back memories of reckless trading that help lead to the mortgage mess and collapse of the housing market. Former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre is accused in a civil trial of cheating investors who bought mortgage-backed securities.  The  Securities and Exchange Commission is accusing Tourre of knowingly selling investments that he expected would go bad. Goldman Sachs settled charges brought against it, paying $550 million. The giant financial firm faces private litigation related to a package of mortgage-based securities sold to investors in 2007. The SEC is seeking unspecified damages against Tourre, saying he failed to tell investors a billionaire-led company helped pick the assets for the securities they invested in even as the firm bet against them. Tourre&amp;#8217;s lawyers say he&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;done nothing wrong.&amp;#8221;
