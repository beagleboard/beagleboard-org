Think about all the things that can go seriously wrong when our astronauts are out in space repairing the satellites. In response to the article, this movie is NOT A SYFY so it can win an award. It is a story about what can happen realistically and technically to a space station with flying debris. It is imaginable. And as far as we surmise, it may have happened but not broadcasted, kept under the radar. The Avatar movie is fantasy and futuristic. The Gravity movie could conceivably be in present day. Why compare at all?? If Sandra Bullock deserves recognition for her performance, give it to her for crying out loud! She embodied the persona of one under extreme duress and for me, as a viewer I struggled right along with her. That is what good acting can produce. Loved George with his antics covering up his anxiety and trying to give calm. That is what a good veteran astronaut would do.
