Folded atop its launch vehicle, Berglund&amp;#8217;s station would measure just 33 feet across (the diameter of the rocket&amp;#8217;s second stage, to which the station would joined as it ascended to orbit). The station would unfold in orbit into a hexagon 150 feet wide. Three spokes would link the hexagon to a central hub where piloted Apollo-derived logistics spacecraft would dock. The hexagon would revolve like a merry-go-round to create acceleration, which the crew inside would feel as gravity. &amp;#8220;Down&amp;#8221; would be away from the hub, toward the hexagon&amp;#8217;s outer rim.
