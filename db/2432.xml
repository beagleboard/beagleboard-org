His rumoured new girlfriend, meanwhile, is 26-year-old Amanda Rosenberg, a Google Glass marketing manager. Ms Rosenberg recently revealed in a post on her Google Plus account that she was responsible for coining the phrase, âOK Glassâ, which users of Glass intone in order to activate the device. Among the other phrases considered for the task were âGo go Glassâ and âGlass alive!â

The structural problem implicit is that ever fewer people working in positions above minimum wage inevitably translates to ever decreasing consumer demand. As this process intensifies there will be increasing disharmony as our societies must define and separate &amp;#8220;needs&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;wants&amp;#8221; and actually prioritize that which sustainable government revenue can provide and to whom.
