Will they make him a target on the field? Cooper became a more important player for the Eagles when Jeremy Maclin tore his ACL early in training camp, but the Eagles would be better off cutting him rather than dealing with a volatile issue that no team needs, It could follow them all season. Cooper stood in front of his teammates and apologized and many seem to be forgiving. Michael Vick tweeted, &quot;Riley&apos;s my friend. Our relationship is mutual respect. He looked me in the eyes and apologized.

He has just 46 catches in three years with the Eagles, production that is easily replaceable.
