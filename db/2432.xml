    <body>Which year are you in? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/genotropin-12-mg-pen-dosage-bf28.pdf&quot;&gt;genotropin use in adults&lt;/a&gt;  But it doesn&apos;t stop there. Added to the figures are the power discs, which will be sold in packs of two for Â£3.99 and which can also be placed onto the Infinity Base: the hexagonal ones change the themed backgrounds in the Toy Box mode, while the circular ones can be placed under the action figures on the base to buff their powers or give them cool new gadgets. This is the true masterstroke really. The Playsets (which provide access to the Playset adventures in the game) retail for around Â£30 each and the figures go for Â£13, which puts both into the birthday/Christmas/special treat category for most kids. However, the power discs are within pocket money range â and can be placed on top of each other in the Base to unlock extra capabilities, so you&apos;ll want lots of them. As a seasoned toy manufacturer, Disney knows how to build licensed goods into spectrums of affordability â whatever a kid has, they can spend it here.
