Regional bingo clubs will be holding the event from October 22 to 29, in the hope that they raise over Â£650,000. There&apos;s the chance to win fluffy pink bunnies or pink sparkly top hats perfect for bingo queens, and if you get all your numbers you could win Â£200,00 courtesy of the National Bingo Game. If you want to support Bingo for Breakthrough call the National Bingo Game Association on 01582 860900 to discover your nearest club. This year, celebrities are going to play and have also been asked to create an art piece, using their Bingo dabbers. The theme is &quot;What&apos;s the best thing about being a woman?&quot; These will be auctioned in October and the public can bid on eBay.
