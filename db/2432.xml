    <body>We went to university together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/stmap_55530.html?toradol.viagra.zyloprim&quot;&gt;24hmeds.com&lt;/a&gt;  The newly introduced iPhone 5s gives customers a compelling reason to upgrade. It looks like it will be a hit, and we believe that AAPL will find novel ways to use Touch ID and iBeacon to monetize its user base and ecosystem via new service offerings and apps. AAPLâs current non-hardware e-commerce business (sales from iTunes, App Store and iBook Store, plus software and services) is $16 billion a year and growing. Not only is it growing faster than Amazon, AAPL makes more money in non-hardware e-commerce alone than Amazon makes in its entire business. That gap will likely widen in AAPLâs favor as AAPL rolls out new offerings and services. We believe that near-term share performance will track the success of the new phones, while the longer-term share price will reflect the marketâs eventual understanding of AAPLâs strong ability to earn high-margin and recurring revenue streams.
