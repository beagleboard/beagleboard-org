Making an example of Mitt Romney, Troy pointed out that the former GOP presidential candidate referred to &quot;Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s dated,&quot; he said of the Matthew Broderick flick, and long-since off the air NBC hit.. &quot;Those references to &apos;Seinfeld&apos; are two decades old,&quot; Troy noted.
