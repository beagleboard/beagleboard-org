The company doesn&amp;#8217;t expect to sell such devices under its own brand, but expects them to serve as prototypes for customers to make gateways of their own.

But the women are also formidable in director Robert Rodriguezâs action flick opening Friday, in which Danny Trejo&apos;s title tough guy takes on a wacko cartel boss (Demian Bichir) and a nutsy industrialist (Mel Gibson).
