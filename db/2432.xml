One simple possibility, Nguyen suggests, is that patients with a spouse or partner at home are more likely to undergo recommended healthcare screening &amp;#8211; accounting for diagnosis at an earlier stage. And if they are diagnosed with cancer, they are more likely to follow through with their treatments and appointments.
