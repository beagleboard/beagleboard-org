This experiments wasn&apos;t used to test whether Nazi guards were really just following orders or not, as it was not done with Nazi specifically. It was made to study the psychological consequences to a person&apos;s behavior of becoming a prisoner or a prisoner guard and used psychology students, who were randomly tasked to be or a prison guard or a prisoner. The results were the guards becoming too violent and agressive, indeed, but also that the prisoners became much more rebels and unwilling to obey the guards (which could be a possible reason for the guards to start enforcing the rules with violence); that way, you can only prove that the guards MAYBE weren&apos;t simply following orders, but as this behavioral exchanges extends themselves to all kinds of prison guards and prisoners, you&apos;re assuming that every prison guard of every POW camp and penitenciary must be condemned for abusing power.
