    <body>Punk not dead  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/anatabine-citrate-for-sale-bd82.pdf#shelves&quot;&gt;anatabine hashimoto&amp;#39s&lt;/a&gt;  I have an Amex Blue card which is more of a credit card than a charge card I guess, since you don&amp;#8217;t have to pay in full each month. I rarely look at the pdf bill since I can review all charges online before I pay ( I never do automatic payments ). I do have a due date though, and I was actually able to set it to my choosing, due to some law passed severa years back that allows consumers to pick ( nearly ) any day of the month to always be the due date. This is nice because previously the due date would shift a little bit as the months are not all the same length and the billing cycle was 30 days which was annoying. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you can do the same thing with a charge card. I would call them or navigate their website and see if you can find an option to &amp;#8216;pick your due date&amp;#8217;. I&amp;#8217;ve also got alerts set on the account to send me emails with a 5 day due date warning.
