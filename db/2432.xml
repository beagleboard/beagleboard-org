    <body>Nice to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/stmap_0a7b0.html?minocin.levitra.retin-a.capoten&quot;&gt;mrsupplement.com.au&lt;/a&gt;  Professor Duerden was brought in by the health board in June to review infection control processes in hospitals in North Wales following an increase in the number of patients with C.diff infections at Denbighshireâs Ysbyty Glan Clwyd earlier this year.

I think it&apos;ll be business as usual. I&apos;m sure there will be more media there obviously tomorrow but I think that&apos;s more for Alex to deal with than the rest of the guys. I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be a big deal.&quot;
