Lorenzo (32-6, 24 KOâs) retreated against the ropes, clearly hurt, and Jacobs sprinted across the ring, whipping lefts and rights that didnât land cleanly. Finally, Jacobs landed a whopper of a right hand that dropped Lorenzo facefirst onto the canvas. Lorenzo tried to get up but stumbled and fell down again, causing referee Steve Willis to stop the bout.
