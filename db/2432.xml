In fewer than 1 percent of cases, the disease is transmitted by exposure to brain or nervous system tissue, and there have been only four reported cases of transmission via surgical instruments. None of those were in the United States, and the most recent case was in 1976, Pepe said.

And for another, the previous studies estimate that Earthâs climate will rapidly respond to the changes. For example, Smith and Mizrahi say itâs unlikely that by 2035, all home wood-burning stoves will be replaced by clean-burning versions of natural gas or electric power. (Previous studies have shown this conversion to be far slower than hoped.) Based on past work, theyâre also dubious that sources of methane such as landfills and leaky pipelines will be equipped to capture the gas before it escapes into the atmosphere.

That is where a coalition of health care outreach groups are coming together.

Last month, a deadline to rule on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley&apos;s continuedownership of trading assets like metal warehouses and oil storage tanks passed without word fromthe Fed.
