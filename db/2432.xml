    <body>We&apos;d like to offer you the job &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/division-pharmacy-manager-safeway-5553.pdf#worthless&quot;&gt;division pharmacy manager safeway&lt;/a&gt;  Darren Cahill, the highly respected former coach of Andre Agassi and Lleyton Hewitt who is working here as a broadcaster for ESPN, said: &quot;I think physically that five-set match with Tsonga was reasonably taxing. While it wasn&apos;t that long a match it was the same sort of style of match that Roger plays. There are five-set matches you can play for four hours and physically you feel OK. There are five-set matches that last three and a half hours and you feel like you&apos;ve hit the wall.
