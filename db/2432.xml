This is a major limitation for imaging comets. Nevertheless, I think we will detect Comet ISON.&quot;

Supervolcano eruptions are thousands of times stronger than those of ordinary volcanoes, and powerful enough to alter global climate and cause mass extinctions. Scientists think they may have formed a series of irregularly shaped craters in an area of Mars known as Arabia Terra. One of the best examples of what might be a supervolcano remnant is Eden Patera (shown in the main image), a depression in the Martian surface 85km wide and 1.8km deep. The finding could completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases and how habitable the surface might have been.
