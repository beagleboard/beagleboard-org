Given his military position, he was certain to know all about Stuxnet. Kaplan noted that Cartwright is also quoted by name in Sanger&apos;s book, Confront and Conceal: Obama&apos;s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, from which the Times article was adapted. And the general had a reputation inside of the Pentagon of being a &quot;lone wolf,&quot; wrote Kaplan, who did things his own way and by himself, and lone wolves often pay a price for their independence.
