Transmitters in Jordan Lake and Gila River, Arizona and one in Lake Kickapoo, Texas act as âfence polesâ for the surveillance system, projecting a virtual fence of radar energy into space. Six receivers in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Mississippi and New Mexico are used to determine what is flying near our planet and how closely. According to the press release, two receivers in California and Georgia have already been decommissioned earlier last April.
