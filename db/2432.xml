    <body>I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m not interested &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/viagra-tablet-chennai-a6a4.pdf#objections&quot;&gt;viagra sold prescription&lt;/a&gt;  A key argument for staying put: Previous shutdowns haven&apos;t had much of an impact on portfolios. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch examined 17 government shutdowns since 1976 (all but three of which took place before 1987 under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan). In the month prior to a government shutdown, the market gained 0.1 percent; it dipped 0.8 percent during a shutdown, and then bounced, gaining about 1.1 percent in the month following a shutdown.

It is about looking good. It is about trying to convince the rest of us that somehow they are putting points up on the board, thus treating us as if weâre the suckers and rubes who canât see the mockery that these people are making out of our political system.

Supporters of immigration reform say religious groups could prove influential with Republicans because of their close ties with lawmakers from the party.

Itâs football, not astrophysics. Rex and his closest coaching confidantes are capable of making an informed decision based on their evaluations.

This would be a good site to start such a letter-writing campaign. If I can track down that original posting I&amp;#8217;ll return and provide the URL. Sounds like a good idea to me. &amp;#8212; that and protesting distributors and the theaters where the movie will be shown. Voices of protest are always heard!
