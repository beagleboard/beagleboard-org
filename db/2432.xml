But last season he attempted just 36.8 percent of his shots in the paint, making just 43.1 percent; Teague registered 57.8 percent of his shots in that zone and made 50.8 percent. Jennings too easily falls for the allure of instant gratification, opting to fire quick jumpers rather than see plays through. He could get better looks for himself and his teammates if he were more patient, but he has seemed far too willing to settle and far too eager to attack opponents with the most inefficient shot in the game. Whether that tendency can be bucked remains to be seen, but Skiles and Jim Boylan had little luck in that regard.
