It was never meant to be that way. The opposite is true: Obamacare, as is it widely known, is supposed to be Obamaâs signature legislative achievement, something many of his predecessors since Teddy Roosevelt more than hundred years ago have in vain tried to accomplish: a European-style health care law that covers almost the entire population. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, as it is officially known, in 2009 against furious opposition of Republicans who still believe that Obamacare is, well, European-style and therefore something coming out of the Marxist-Socialist toolbox.
