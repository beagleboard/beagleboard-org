Fair credit to Australia they bowled well all day and made it hard to score fluently. The pitch is slow and hard to time the ball on. We have seen people like Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen score fluently but it was not that easy even for them. We have played pretty well to get to where we have.&amp;rdquo;

The ratio of one woman to four male presenters had to be addressed. Now the balance is better. This Thursday, rumour has it that Sarah Montague and Mishal Husain will be presenting together. Corrie Corfield will be reading the news and with a bit of luck we might have Alison Mitchell on sport. There may even be more women&amp;rsquo;s voices than men&amp;rsquo;s!
