    <body>Will I have to work shifts? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/wwwswissmedicalcomar-31f1.pdf#standstill&quot;&gt;www.swissmedical.com.ar cartilla medica&lt;/a&gt;  Letâs see how these two stack up against one another, on the one hand you have a very dangerous striker in Shogun, with a total of 18 victories coming by the way of knock out. As well as this Shogun in my opinion is in the group of Pride veterans and anyone who has fought in Pride has got to have good stand up. The majority of his knockouts were racked up when he was fighting under the Pride flag. With knock outs and TKO victories over big names such as Rampage Jackson, Alistair Overeem, Chuck Liddell, Mark Coleman, Kevin Randleman and Lyoto Machida. This shows how devastating his stand up can be, lets not forget his Black Belt in BJJ.
