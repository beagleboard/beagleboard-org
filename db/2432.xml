Attorneys for the association are expected to discuss the matter with board members at a meeting this week.

There are also plans, mainly in Europe, to pay a chunk of bankersâ compensation in âbail-in bondsâ &amp;#8211; which will get wiped out or turned into lowly valued shares if a bank fails. That should get bankers to pay more attention to risk.
