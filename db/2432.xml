    <body>Could you please repeat that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/wwwtasmanmedicalconz-7684.pdf#grudge&quot;&gt;med1.net&lt;/a&gt;  The researchers, from the National Forensic Service in South Korea and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, noted that the compound found in Craze was the same as that found in a crystalline powder seized by narcotics agents in December 2011 as a suspected illicit designer drug. In that case the powder was found in an unclaimed lost package shipped from Vietnam to South Korea, according to an earlier journal article published by the team in late 2012. &quot;It appeared that the recipient of this article sought to abuse this chemical in the same way as amphetamines. There is a possibility that this chemical will be widely abused for recreational use in the near future,&quot; they wrote at the time.
