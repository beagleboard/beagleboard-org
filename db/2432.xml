    <body>How much were you paid in your last job? &lt;a href=&quot;https://accentresurfacing.com/port-credit-village-pharmacy---mississauga-on-4110.pdf#lately&quot;&gt;port credit village pharmacy - mississauga on&lt;/a&gt;  Does it matter that Zimmerman followed Trayvon for no reason, that the dispatcher told him to stop, that he got out of his vehicle and confronted the kid with a loaded weapon? The fact that Trayvon was a better fighter than him does not mean Trayvon started the fight. By all accounts, Zimmerman started the fight. Seems to me that Zimmerman shooting the kid was Zimmerman&amp;#8217;s fault, no matter whether Trayvon was on top or not.
