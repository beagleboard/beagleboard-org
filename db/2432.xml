But in this case, we&amp;#8217;re not just talk about foregone theoretical proceeds: we&amp;#8217;re talking about real cash, which Verizon is going to need to pay out to bond investors for decades to come. The $15 billion 30-year bond will pay a total of $29.25 billion in coupon payments over its lifetime; if it had come at a yield of 6.1%, that number would have been $27.45 billion &amp;#8212; a savings of $1.8 billion in cash.

Rising confidence was one reason consumer spending picked up slightly in the second quarter of this year, helping the economy return to growth. Figures released by the European Union&amp;#8217;s official statistics agency indicate that the pickup in spending may have continued into the third quarter, with retail sales having risen in both July and August.
