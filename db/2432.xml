We do have a large LGBT community in S.L.C, and it is growing, and they are also quite safe here, go figure!! BUT THEN... &quot;THE CHURCH&quot; SNEAKS behind everyone&apos;s back and gives 8 MILLION Dollars to Andy Pugno, to Campaign for &quot;Prop 8&quot;!! AND THEN... Walks WITH our LGBT community in their annual &quot;PRIDE PARADE&quot;, I have NEVER seen such hypocrites in my entire life as those in the Mormon Church!!!
