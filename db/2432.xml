The 14-year-old stood numbly, not crying until officials wheeled the coffin toward a hearse. Then Gurvinder collapsed in tears, inconsolable, telling his mother he wanted to die in the same flames that would cremate his father.

Indeed, after his own deeply disturbed fashion Epps loves Patsey, certainly more than he loves his embittered wife (the terrific Sarah Paulson), an ambiguous character who crackles with passion sublimated into madness and sadism. My own reading of the situation is that sheâd like to do with Solomon just as her husband does with Patsey, but such erotic options were not really available to a plantation wife, trapped in her cocoon of comfort. Solomon is redeemed from slavery in the end, through the improbable agency of Brad Pitt as a Canadian carpenter. (The title of the film, I suppose, is a spoiler.) But â12 Years a Slaveâ offers no false Hollywood catharsis along with its muted happy ending, because weâre not free from the curse of slavery yet. Looking at it, as it really was, is a start.

I did research on all these guys, and many of them have radio shows. If you&apos;re doing sports radio, you have to be able to talk about multiple topics. I don&apos;t see why they aren&apos;t able to do that. They have to do their homework. The insight they can bring, not only about their particular sport, they also can talk intelligently about whether it&apos;s basketball or baseball or hockey. We will have baseball-specific people and hockey-specific people, but they can join into the conversation and add to the conversation.
