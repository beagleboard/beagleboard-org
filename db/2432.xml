    <body>I&apos;ve got a part-time job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jalapaoecolodge.com.br/index.php/stmap_7abb0.html?hydrochlorothiazide.diamox.eldepryl.viagra&quot;&gt;diamox online canada&lt;/a&gt;  Currently, there is resistance at the government level in Indonesia to both capturing additional rhinos that are so desperately needed to enhance the gene pool and exchanging rhinos for breeding so that inbreeding can be avoided.  Furthermore, the permit process put in place to protect endangered species can be slow and cumbersome, often stalling out efforts among global partners to exchange gametes for assisted reproduction attempts.  Finally, even though most conservationists now agree that captive breeding must be a part of the Sumatran rhino recovery effort, financial support for the program is exceedingly difficult to obtain.  Most US federal dollars for conservation are restricted and will not even be considered for captive breeding efforts.  That being said, the cost of maintaining Sumatran rhinos is significant because their diet is complex, much like that of the giant panda&amp;#39;s, but donors flock to the popular giant panda and remain relatively unaware of this unique rhino&amp;#39;s critical situation.
