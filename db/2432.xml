That morning she heard that One Direction were booked to perform on the US version of The X Factor and speculation about their arrival gained traction when the band was photographed entering Heathrow at 2pm. Soon after that some of the band&amp;rsquo;s more than 11 million Twitter followers deduced that they must be taking the 4.15pm British Airways flight to LA. Sitting next to her father, Tracy, Sarah tracked the flight&amp;rsquo;s progress on her phone. The plane was due to land 30 minutes early, which gave her 15 minutes to get to the airport.
