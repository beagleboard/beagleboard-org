Only because of US veto power in the UN does the current impasse continue.

No doubt the Japanese military have secret very close relationships with Japanese industrial high-tech to thwart real cyber-snoopers with serious warnings that they will be absolutely crushed unless they stop. And they do. Cyber-death can be savage, I&amp;#8217;m told. And US security complaining and wanting closer ties and agreeing is like opening your doors to somebody you don&amp;#8217;t trust.
