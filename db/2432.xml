The video in this article may show a new version of that. Einstein opened a door for quantum theory in connection with the electron and photon. âAnd your old-school CRT monitor or TV was, technically, a particle accelerator.ââForbes. Quantum theory assumes Einsteinâs general theory of relativity, and he challenged quantum theory saying, âGod does not play dice.â In 1964 the Nobel committee chose the relativity quantum road, overlooking flawed non-Euclidean geometry in Einsteinâs general theory of relativity and overlooking Einsteinâs views of quantum mechanics. Yet if Einstein was right about general relativity, subsequent scientific developments apparently show his challenges to quantum theory are wrongâIF he was right about general relativity.  But what if Einstein was wrong about general relativity, because it is flawed by self-contradicting non-Euclidean geometry, and right about dice?  Check out the FB Note, Not The God Particle, The God Field if you must call it that: https://www.facebook.com/notes/reid-barnes/not-the-god-particle-the-god-field-if-you-must-call-it-that/519767374742508

In the wake of so much freedom, the boss fights, one-dimensional battles in which you had to kill, felt strangely jarring. And traditional skirmishes felt equally strange, breaking the realistic immersion by standing in front of tunnel openings âsearchingâ for you as you calmly picked them off, one by one.
