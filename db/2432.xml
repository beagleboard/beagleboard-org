These measures made little difference to Nohl as he managed to crack the messages no matter what protection was used. The keys are largely based on the old DES algorithm. The OTA server and the SIM card use the same key â likely a decision made to conserve space on the SIM cards. You figure out the key and you can trick the SIM card into thinking that you are the network provider. The vast majority of SIM cards still use at least one DES key â most cards have multiple keys that are used for various purposes. Some manufacturers are upgrading to 3DES and fewer still are deploying AES, but these more secure keys are only on the most recently manufactured SIM cards, not the one already in phones.

But that was just the start of a line rebuilding project that shouldâve began in 2011 when Shaun OâHara and Rich Seubert were cut. Now, with so many veterans hurt, their inexperience is glaring.
