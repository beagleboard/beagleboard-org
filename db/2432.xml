Police and the London Ambulance Service found two women suffering from gunshot injuries and both were taken to hospital - where Ms Moss was later pronounced dead. The other woman was said to be recovering in hospital. Tributes began flowing on to social networking sites in praise of Ms Moss after her death was reported - with many reporting she had a young son.
