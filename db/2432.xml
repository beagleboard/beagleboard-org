At most elections of modern times, the rule is that the north belongs to Labour and the south to the Tories and the bits of each that don&apos;t are scooped up by the Lib Dems or Nationalists. Mrs Thatcher&apos;s long-term legacy to her party was to turn the great cities of the north into electoral wastelands for the Tories. Tony Blair&apos;s magic had gone by his late period and Labour support in the south collapsed altogether once the party dumped him for the Scottish Gordon Brown.
