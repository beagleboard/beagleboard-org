    <body>I&apos;m a housewife &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/acne-serum-5553.pdf#jewellery&quot;&gt;acne serum ingredients&lt;/a&gt;  At Botsford&amp;rsquo;s memorial service in 2005, Malcolm described his editing style with love.&amp;lsquo;I remember the first time I was edited by him. I read the page proof that was the result of the many pencil marks he had made on my manuscript, and I felt the kind of pleasure one feels when coming upon a wonderful painting or on hearing a gorgeous aria. In the most dazzlingly deft way, without in any way changing its meaning, Gardner had transformed bumpy writing into polished prose. Over the years, I became more blas√© about his editing, as one does about indoor plumbing, but I treasure the memory of my first encounter with its almost uncanny delicacy and potency.&amp;rsquo;
