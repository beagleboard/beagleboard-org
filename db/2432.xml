Google seems to be doing so much to improve its business but Apple is doing nothing or possibly moving in reverse. Google has branched out into different lines of business including hardware while Apple can only rely on selling iPhones to get its revenue. Now that the smartphone market has dried up, Apple is in a downward spiral and likely to never recover what it once had now that Steve Jobs is gone. Timid Cook is near useless as a CEO and should be taking lessons from Jeff Bezos and Larry Page on how to build up a company&amp;#8217;s shareholder value. Apple&amp;#8217;s high-flying days sure didn&amp;#8217;t last very long after Android smartphones took over the smartphone industry.

But, as he did on the first, he saved par after a bad drive on 18 to âget something out of the round that I felt could have been special.â
