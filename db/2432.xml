He was the first President of the merged party, presiding over both its calamitous early years and the beginnings of revival. With a background in business in North East England, in 2010&amp;ndash;12 he worked alongside Michael Heseltine in heading the Regional Growth Fund Advisory Panel. In 2012, he became Treasurer of the Liberal Democrats, spearheading the party&apos;s fundraising efforts, and this year was raised to the peerage.
