All you replied was your opinion on how many rounds I should have, as if you know best. Believe me brother, between Iraq and Afghanistan, I&apos;ve been through more combat than you have ever even read about in your recliner at home. So on my state run shooting matches you think it would make sense to carry fourteen 6 round magazines, or would you just put that sport to rest? And your point about our founding father&apos;s is pointless. Musket rifles were the top weapon of the time, for both government and civilians. That&apos;s when the second amendment was written, thus making the citizens an equal power to the government. Yes I cling to the second amendment that I defended. What gives you the right to manipulate it what you want it to say? If I had my way, we would stop putting restrictions on law abiding citizens.
