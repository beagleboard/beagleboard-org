Need more money, go to the bank and borrow. This is no way to live and this is what is going to cause the economy to collapse. If we can&amp;#8217;t cover our expenses at the moment right now, how are we going to cover them in 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? We aren&amp;#8217;t. The Federal government is going the way of the cities like Detroit and Stockton. Sooner or later, we will be cut off and we will begin defaulting on our debts.

Stop spending my generations money!
