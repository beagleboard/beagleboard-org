How is that possible when like, 96% of what creates the greenhouse effect is water vapor? Only 1/4 of a single percent is estimated to be man made Co2. I mean seriously&amp;#8230; Are people really this dumb? Man made Co2 &amp;#8220;global warming&amp;#8221;, is going to go down as one of the world&amp;#8217;s biggest jokes of all time. 100 years from now, they&amp;#8217;re going to teach little kids about this in school, and they&amp;#8217;ll laugh at us.

When I was 16, I ended up following my mum&amp;rsquo;s side more than my dad&amp;rsquo;s. She&amp;rsquo;d been to art school and that&amp;rsquo;s where I decided to go &amp;ndash; to Withens Lane in Wallasey to do a preliminary art and design course.

If I&amp;rsquo;d continued, it was sculpture I&amp;rsquo;d have chosen. I sometimes think that manipulating dough is a bit like sculpture.
