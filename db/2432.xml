He put all that aside the first time he heard jazz performer Chris Anderson, and under Anderson&apos;s tutelage, went on to play in Miles Davis&apos; Second Great Quintet. He has composed and recorded a number of jazz tunes, many of them Grammy Award winning, and is known for his collaborations with pop and electronic musicians.
