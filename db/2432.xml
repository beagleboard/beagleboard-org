    <body>Who&apos;s calling? &lt;a href=&quot;https://oporajeyo.com/stmap_bf450.html?trimethoprim.cialis.procyclidine&quot;&gt;slippery stuff gel uk&lt;/a&gt;  A U.S. official said on Tuesday the United States was leaning toward withholding most military aid to Egypt except to promote counter-terrorism and other security priorities.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/stmap_55220.html?chloroquine.neurontin.viagra.coreg&quot;&gt;jual hersolution gel&lt;/a&gt;  @hawk420 So the guy who has slang for marijuana in his handle is talking about freedom and consequences&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s irony for you. Let me spell it out for you the &amp;#8220;Rule of law&amp;#8221; was already dismissed when the US government killed journalists in Afghanistan in a blatant war crime, Manning takes the evidence to his superiors and they dismiss it and tell him to move on&amp;#8230; he does by leaking to the press. Now the people who committed the war crimes are not punished but he is. The superiors who ignored his reporting of a war crime are not punished. The rule of law should apply to everyone equally. Right now it does not apply to the US government and you&amp;#8217;re not scared by this instead you applaud the true law breakers in persecuting someone who did the right thing. This is why America is heading into fascism.
