    <body>Can I use your phone? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/tofranil-for-sleep-bf28.pdf&quot;&gt;imipramine toxicity&lt;/a&gt;  Because back-to-school shopping has the aura of necessity, it&apos;s easy to make impulsive purchases. That&apos;s especially true when you walk into the store fatigued, starving, or at 11 p.m. the night before the first day of school. In addition to paying too much money, your distracted brain might cause you to make poor credit decisions, and end up throwing everything on a higher interest credit card because you are too tired to care. While this last point may not seem like personal finance advice, it is. Eat something before you shop. Take a nap if you can. Go early. By taking all the above common-sense steps to guard your finances and avoid credit mistakes, your child&apos;s schooling on important financial matters will start long before the buses start rolling again.
