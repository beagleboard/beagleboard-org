The lucky tax collectors who attended a lunch of the Association of HM Inspectors of Taxes on 28 August 1952 probably thought so when Churchill, evidently having enjoyed some excellent browsing and sluicing, assured them that, &amp;ldquo;We are relying on you to extract more and more money from those who guilelessly elected us to office&amp;rdquo;.

(One of the really surprising things about Netflix and YouTube&amp;#39;s support for Chromecast was that I didn&amp;#39;t have to update their apps on my phone to get it - the Chromecast button just showed up in the apps on every device. Watch for that to happen with every other video service you use.)
