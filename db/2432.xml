For far too long, Treasury has chosen a risky strategy of shortening the duration of the nation&apos;s financing instruments by borrowing in one week, one month, six-month and one year instruments, instead of borrowing in five to 10-year instruments. This exposes us to the dangers of a volatile interest rate environment. Rolling a portion of our nation&apos;s debt into long term servicing instruments, such as a 60-year bond, will allow us to manage our debt exposure beyond the baby-boomer demographic bubble and avoid the danger of a spiking interest rate environment.

The pregnant actress stepped out to get her (decaf?) coffee fix in Los Angeles on June 30, 2013, putting her prominent bump on display in a loose-fitting gray T-shirt. The 34-year-old TV star announced in early June that her and her &quot;The Client List&quot; co-star beau, Brian Hallisay, were engaged and expecting.
