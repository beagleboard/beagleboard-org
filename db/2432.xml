There are wild strawberry plants and raspberry canes growing at the base of the shade-providing trees that separate walkers, joggers and cyclists from the narrow band of accompanying track 20 metres away.

The presence of water ice, he says, supports the idea that Saturnâs superstorms are powered by condensation of water and originate deep in the atmosphere, about 200 kilometers below the visible cloud deck.
