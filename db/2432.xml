They arenât required to have the 20 percent equity in their properties lenders typically stipulate for a refinancing. The program was expanded in 2011 to include all government-backed mortgages -- instead of the limit to mortgages 25 percent or less underwater in the first version -- and some fees were lowered. The new version is called Harp 2.0. In May, the deadline for Harp was extended to 2015.

Shipments are down from 7.7 million in Q2 of 2012 (again, using IDCâs recent numbers), to 6.8  million shipments. The 2013 numbers include the new BB10 devices, but also the established BB7 handsets. Nokiaâs numbers are almost exclusively Lumia handsets running Windows Phone. BlackBerryâs numbers are split over BB7 and BB10, and the trend is downwards. They can spin the argument that their market share will be low as an effective start-up against Android, but the unit numbers tell the story far more clearly.
