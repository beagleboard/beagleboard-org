    <body>Very Good Site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/what-does-omeprazole-dr-20-mg-look-like-0a7b.pdf&quot;&gt;omeprazole tablet strength&lt;/a&gt;  jimS pretty much tired of your completely blinded brainwashed liberal selfish ignorance...impeach &quot;SELF&quot; you need the bumper sticker of t-shirt . How is it all those years and everyone wanted change and blamed and blamed and blamed and so many citizens were already fed up with govt. yadyadad then you voted for change and voted for a pendulum the other direction without any balance. Now its more of a mess, and the blame lays on foolish citizens that dont understand the machine of politics and how govt works and how the founders designed it so iron could sharpen iron in the gray areas so more can get along ...Leftists are catering to the enemies abroad and giving more power to the tyrants of the world that are not interested in a war with boots on the ground but are looking to cripple the USA and break down its will as being tough people who never give up . I blame the citizens and sometimes myself too, but mostly i been fighting trying to play along and play by more rules. America was blessed and can remain blessed if it clings to being &quot;the least&quot; and the underdog and stop this liberal freaking whining all the time. You still blaming Bush and Republican ? Your a moron period...citizens make the difference people who care, nurses, laborers people trying and people believing in Christ and having repentance and knowing there is a purpose beyond just the earthly govt and not whether there are jobs or no The Lord finds a way it just might not be the comfortable way - its time to unite and not blame if your cause is truth it will stand the test of time. I blame entitlement and idea that everything America is will always be , I blame people no longer willing to sacrifice as much , whining when they have no luxury instead of finding the blessing in it. Wanting more and wanting al equality in areas equality was not intended. Progressives added things to govt. and what it should fund and control over the years , too many things and people even in poverty got spoon fed instead of learning the hard way which build character and if you think other nations are not joining in to take advantage of that and you are not man enough to stand firm still for this nation well your a moron and you are the problem too.. Wake up JIM
