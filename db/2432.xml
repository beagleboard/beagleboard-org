While it can break new ground and generate plenty of hype, it often fails at creating cohesive experiences. I&amp;#8217;ve also noticed that it typically takes Samsung three tries before it gets a handle on new device categories (for example, see the Galaxy S 3, its third-generation of tablets, and the upcoming Note 3). That means, while the Gear may be an unrefined experience now, it could get better in a few years. At that point though, Apple&amp;#8217;s iWatch may be on the market and Google Glass will be available to all, so it could be too late to make much of a difference.
