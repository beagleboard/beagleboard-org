He was 34. The daredevil, known to fans for his gross-out stunts alongside Johnny Knoxville, was in a Porsche that was traveling down Route 322 in West Goshen Township in Pennsylvania around 3 a.m. when it went over a guardrail, crashed into trees and burst into flames. Both Dunn and an unidentified occupant perished. Pittsburgh radio station 96.1&apos;s The Morning Freak Show is reporting Dunn was behind the wheel when the car crashed.
