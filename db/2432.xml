    <body>Could you send me an application form? &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/gnc-pro-performance-amp-amplified-creatine-189-reviews-7ef0.pdf#clothe&quot;&gt;amp amplified creatine 189 side effects&lt;/a&gt;  Home was where we were supposed to meet; home was the emergency arrangement; she must have realised how useless it would be, trying to find me in all that crush. But still I felt a petty, irrational pang of disappointment &amp;ndash; and, as I walked home (skull-cracking headache, practically seeing double) I kept looking for her, scanning the anonymous, preoccupied faces around me. She&amp;rsquo;d gotten out; that was the important thing. She&amp;rsquo;d been rooms away from the worst part of the explosion. None of the bodies was her. But no matter what we had agreed upon beforehand, no matter how much sense it made, somehow I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite believe she had walked away from the museum without me.
