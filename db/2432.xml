The United States, with the largest nuclear arsenal, must be willing to decommission our weapons if we expect and demand other nations to do the same. If we are not prepared to give up our dependence on nuclear weapons for our own security (even with our huge conventional forces), then we cannot presume other nations with much weaker and smaller forces to do so either. Especially as we improve our arsenal, it is folly to think other nations will unilaterally disarm.
