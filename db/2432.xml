    <body>Special Delivery &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/stamina-rx-buy-69bc.pdf#wasp&quot;&gt;stamina rx 2 oz&lt;/a&gt;  When he reached 90, I could bear it no longer. Reader, I turned him in. Apart from anything else, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want him to kill our mother. I rang the DVLA and told them he was not fit to drive. I identified myself and they promised me anonymity when they wrote to him. It seemed I was not alone: at the time they were getting 127,000 such notifications every year. In the ensuing uproar, after the official letter arrived on my father&amp;rsquo;s doormat, I lied. &amp;ldquo;No, of course not, Dad.&amp;rdquo; An unfortunate neighbour was blamed as the culprit and my father never spoke to him again. There was then a great deal of fuss, before my father did as directed and took himself off to the doctor&amp;rsquo;s surgery. The doctor asked if he wished to continue driving, my father said he did, the doctor ticked the box, signed the form and my father got another three-year licence.
