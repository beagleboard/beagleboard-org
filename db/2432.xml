And as sad as we are to see Lorna Simpson voted off at this early stage, at least she did it in some serious style. She was sparkling to the max in an outfit that we thought was a jumpsuit at first, but actually consists of a Missguided crop top, Topshop trousers, Dorothy Perkins shoes and a quirky Butler and Wilson Scorpio bracelet.
