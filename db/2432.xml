The next one does, but I think that it&apos;s a plausible view. That is, zero inflation in an economy that grows as slowly as the American economy now grows would mean either significant nominal wage cuts or unemployment. For example, the real wage of college professors fell by 30 percent between 1970 and 1980. Had we been in a 2 percent inflation era, real wages would have fallen by only 20 percent. What would have happened? Scholars over age 35 probably would have kept their jobs. I suspect that those under 35 would have fallen victim to lower staffing requirements if real wages had not been able to fall. Would nominal wages have started to fall if the inflation rate had been low? Perhaps, but not as easily as in an inflationary environment. Certainly the standard tenure provision in university contracts draws sharp distinction between nominal declines and real declines. Eventually that could get itself renegotiated,but it would take a long time.

The group is linked to the botched Christmas Day 2009 bombing of an airliner bound for Detroit and explosives-laden parcels intercepted aboard cargo flights a year later â both incidents involving al-Asiri&apos;s expertise.
