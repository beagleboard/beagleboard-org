    <body>I live in London &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/wwwbroughtyferryhealthcentrecouk-f2ef.pdf&quot;&gt;healthslate.com&lt;/a&gt;  Gates was the one who rather recently appointed Ray Ozzie as Microsoft CTO.

It was just the same old Bill Gates whim and whimsy that had nothing to do with the company&amp;#8217;s real strategic needs, the same mindset that has hobbled its chances since he tried to take over the Internet and then quickly lost interest.
