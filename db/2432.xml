I&amp;rsquo;m impressed that at 88 you are not on any medication and I can understand your reluctance to change this. Your symptoms are most likely due to the condition known as BPH or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia which as its name suggests is due to a benign enlargement of the prostate rather than the cancer you mention. The prostate shrinking drug Finasteride would certainly improve your symptoms though it can take up to six months to have any noticeable effect. I would have thought it sensible to discuss this further with your doctor.
