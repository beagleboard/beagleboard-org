The blog is also a way for us to provide GlobalPost&amp;rsquo;s in-depth reporting and foundation-supported Special Reports &amp;mdash; on rights relating to labor, gender, sexuality, the environment, the Internet, children, speech and assembly, and more &amp;mdash; with steady updates, insights and analysis worth sharing. This is a blog called RIGHTS, but the story telling here about those rights are not intended as advocacy and will always stay true to GlobalPost&amp;rsquo;s reporting standards of fairness, accuracy and independence.
