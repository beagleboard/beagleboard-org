By sending protons around the circular Large Hadron Collider tunnel at 99.99999 percent the speed of light, researchers were able to observe 40 million collisions per second. When particles collide at such high speeds, the energy released is enough to create new particles. After years of collisions, the two main detectors at CERN, ATLAS and CMS, detected the creation of a particle with just the right mass â about a hundred times heavier than a proton â to be the Higgs particle.
