    <body>I&apos;m doing a phd in chemistry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcmpovos.com/livegymcamcom-62bd.pdf#continent&quot;&gt;viagrasaludable.com&lt;/a&gt;  So first of all as you know the first half of the year was quite successful for end-user competing business in both Q1 and Q2 we grew the business in our mid-teens and I would like to point out in Q3 both our EMEA and APAC regions were up you know double digits again year-over-year. Well, what we did not see in Q3 which we traditionally see is any large if you will VDI sales in the Americas and with Americas being the largest percentage of our overall bookings from a region perspective if we go and execute on EUC business in that respective region, it could have a slight impact for the quarter and thatâs what we saw.
