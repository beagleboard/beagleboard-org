The real importance of the Nasdaq, then, is not its status as an exchange, but rather its status as a SIP.

The 43-year-old actress was in Rio de Janeiro promoting her new movie &quot;Hangover Part III,&quot; but that didn&apos;t mean the blond stunner didn&apos;t have time to splash around in the waves. The star drew plenty of attention frolicking along the shore at Ipanema Beach on May 28, 2013.
