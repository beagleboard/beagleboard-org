Not only do retirees deserve the benefits we were promised, the State under law owes retirees the COLAs they paid into. Slashing COLAs as suggested in the Univ of Illinois Institute of Government and Public Affairs proposal would result in draconian cuts to a retiree&amp;#8217;s standard of living.

Beijing&apos;s increased presence, in turn, would drastically hamper the ability of the U.S. to hunt for contraband or to keep enemy naval assets from entering the Latin American region. It also could create the ability for the Chinese Navy to move warships into the Caribbean and the Atlantic, at will. It is also not beyond the realm of possibility that a Chinese-controlled canal, located in an openly-hostile nation like Nicaragua, could be used to facilitate staging for hostile naval or military forces.
