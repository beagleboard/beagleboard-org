These include age greater than 65, family history of prostate cancer, diets rich in red meat or with high fat content, increased consumption of dairy products and obesity. Prostate cancer also is more common in African-Americans compared to Caucasians and can present as a more advanced disease in African-American men.

Chou kept his sales, product,marketing and design executives separate and, in some cases,created parallel teams doing the same thing. He didn&apos;t holdmeetings of executives of the different departments to iron outproblems even as HTC&apos;s performance wilted. &quot;There&apos;s a culture inHTC not to discuss numbers at senior management meetings,&quot; saidone former executive. &quot;Those discussions tend to become hard orugly, but if you don&apos;t solve it, it becomes bigger.&quot;
