And specifically John in server virtualization, I think you guys all understand the penetration rate that we had in the market and the percentage of workloads that are virtualized out there in data center today. And as Pat indicated, we see this as a strong foundation for us to build upon for the software-defined data center. At the same time, we see a rich opportunity going forward for the non-virtualized workloads, because they are most mission-critical Tier 1 applications and we do know that as people look to virtualize the remaining workloads in their data center, they are looking for more high availability, disaster recovery business continuity solutions and they are also looking for different levels of how to manage and operate in this new world of the software-defined data center. So widely adoption of the remaining workloads to a virtualized state maybe slower than that first 60% or 70% we have picked up over the last decade. We actually see a significant up-sell opportunity as we grab to those mission-critical workloads in the future.

Daley just announced heâs running for Illinois governor and is doing so with the unabashed endorsement of Bloomberg.
