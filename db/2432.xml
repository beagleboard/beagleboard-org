Parents should make sure their child has an ID that they carry with him or her. Parents should also always have a current, full face, photo of their child that they keep in a place that&apos;s not readily visible. In that same place, they should keep any other important documents about their child. &quot;That picture speaks a thousand words and people have somebody to look for and it&apos;s a real person,&quot; McBride said.
