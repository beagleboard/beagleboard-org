    <body>Why did you come to ? &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/stmap_22060.html?valparin.viagra.zaditor&quot;&gt;suppliersof cialis&lt;/a&gt;  The thing is, the round started as though Woods was continuing the momentum of Akron. Starting on the 10th, he had two birdies in his first six holes. As the names that usually clutter the top of the first-day leaderboard of a PGA did their thing, Woods was right there at the turn, his putter, the tool that did him in at the British Open, rock-solid, being used just 11 times as he saved par after par.
