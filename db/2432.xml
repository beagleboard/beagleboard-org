An unknown number of pro-Morsi protesters were killed in Egypt&apos;s capital today as Egyptian Security Forces undertook a planned operation to clear Morsi supporters from two sit-in demonstrations in Cairo where they have camped for over one month. Egyptian Police and Army forces entered protest sites in the Nasr City and Giza districts at dawn using tear gas, live fire and bulldozers to disperse protesters and destroy the camps. A state of emergency has been declared in Egypt to begin this afternoon and will reportedly last for one month.
