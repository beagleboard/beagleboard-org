Eric Young Jr. cut the Mets&apos; deficit to one run with a double to right, but Daniel Murphy flied to left against reliever David Hernandez for the third out.

But then the Nationals continued to underachieve, the front-running Atlanta Braves started coming back to the pack and the Phillies went on an 8-3 run leading into the All-Star break. When they pummeled the Mets in the first game of this series, it put them over .500 for the first time since June 6 and enabled them to leapfrog over the Nationals into second place. Now, after two straight losses to the Mets, they are back under .500 and only the continued losing on the Nationalsâ part is keeping the Phillies in further suspense.
