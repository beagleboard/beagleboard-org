    <body>Have you seen any good films recently? &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?staytal.viagra.chlorpromazine&quot;&gt;is tylenol ibuprofen or acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt;  The working day that started at 3am after only two hours sleep continued until 1am the following morning. The army, visibly over-stretched, only allowed media access onto their Maritime Squadron base for the arrival of the first two boats in the evening. The army media officers were as burnt out as we journalists were, so no one complained when we were asked to leave. I had more than enough pictures to tell the story.
