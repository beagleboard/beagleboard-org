The increases were mainly seen among men in the 27 European and 18 American countries, with rates 4.2 and 6.4 percent higher, respectively, than expected based on earlier trends. No change was seen in the suicide rates for women in European countries, while in the Americas there was a 2.3 percent increase. The highest increases were seen for European men aged 15 to 24 years (11.7 percent), while the largest increase in American countries was among men aged 45 to 64 years (5.2 percent). For men, there was an association between increases in national suicide rates with the magnitude of increases in unemployment, especially in countries with low pre-crisis levels of unemployment.
