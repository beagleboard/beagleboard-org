    <body>We work together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/stmap_9e880.html?cialis.crestor.abacavir&quot;&gt;pillendienstde.com erfahrungen&lt;/a&gt;  It is a real problem for Labour that its conversion to free-market economics and the politics of social aspiration did not work out as planned. Having been embraced in bad faith &amp;ndash; at least by Gordon Brown, through whose agency it had to be administered &amp;ndash; it led the party and the country into a disastrous trap. The market economy, so far as Mr Brown was concerned, was good for one thing: to produce wealth that could be taxed. It was tax revenue &amp;ndash; which would be used to cure poverty and deliver social equality &amp;ndash; that was the real objective.
