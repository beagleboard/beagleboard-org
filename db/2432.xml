    <body>What do you study? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdesighn.com/freds-xpress-pharmacy-hamilton-al-b26f.pdf#journal&quot;&gt;fred&apos;s xpress pharmacy union ms&lt;/a&gt;  Criminal investigations now hardly matter, because most of the frauds took place before 2008. Under the five-year statute of limitations for most federal frauds, governments let the crooks run out the clock. They keep their riches, their reputations, their jobs and, absent real reform and real regulation, plunder on. Both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations have let the crooks escape. The challenger who wants to replace President Obama would be even worse. Mitt Romney wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. Unless some determined and creative prosecutor finds a way to pursue the wrongdoers, there will be no justice, just more gambling with taxpayers on the hook to pay off the markers. OnlyÂ Eric Schneiderman, the New York state attorney general, offers any hope, but his staff is tiny and the crimes are mighty. Keep in mind that in 2004 the FBI and theÂ Mortgage Bankers Association in 2004 said there were only two kinds of mortgage fraud, both of them perpetrated by unqualified borrowers who could not repay their loans. The FBI said nothing about banks profiting off huge fees for issuing fraudulent &amp;#8220;liar loans,&amp;#8221; nor about why banks lacked standards and practices to turn away unqualified borrowers. I&amp;#8217;ll call that &amp;#8220;investigativeness.&amp;#8221;
