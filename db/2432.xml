Itâs adjustable, but instead of having to feed the watch band through the clasp every time you put it on, once you adjust it to fit, it snaps on and off with a bracelet-like hinge. The camera is embedded into the strap so unlike the Pebble, you wonât be able to switch straps if you want to colour coordinate with your wardrobe.The Gear comes in six colours although in Canada weâll only be able to get it in three of those â black, beige and orange. No lime green, orange or gold here although you can change the colour of the watch face to match or contrast with the band. Personally I thought an orange band with purple face was quite fetching.

Wondolowski, Donovan and Holden all are making a case to be included in the player pool when World Cup qualifying resumes in September. While Wondolowski has led or tied Major League Soccer in goals for three straight seasons, he hadnât scored for the national team in 11 appearances before an exhibition win over Guatemala on July 5.
