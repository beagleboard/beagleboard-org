    <body>I don&apos;t like pubs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jalapaoecolodge.com.br/index.php/stmap_7abb0.html?paxil.naproxen.cialis.tadapox&quot;&gt;rexavar symptoms&lt;/a&gt;  Bien-pensants back in the UK may want Gibraltar to be shared with Spain, or better still handed over lock, stock and barrel, but it is hard to see it happening any time soon. &quot;We&apos;re not interested in discussing sovereignty,&quot; says Brugada. &quot;If you think of the days that led up to the closure of the frontier and the [Spanish] state [that existed under Franco], and the so-called democratic government of today and what they have been doing to us every other year when it suits them to raise the temperature at the border in pursuance of their sovereignty claim, how could we ever want to be under that regime which does not even respect its own people? No one with two ounces of common sense could enter into that discussion.&quot;
