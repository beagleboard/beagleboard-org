    <body>I was made redundant two months ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelifesinsurancequotes.com/alli-orlistat-precio-argentina-6f97.pdf#hatch&quot;&gt;orlistat prescription cost&lt;/a&gt;  Now, moving to guidance. Since Q3, total revenues finished according to our expectations. We are maintaining the midpoint of full year 2013 guidance of $5.190 billion and narrowing the range to between $5.175 billion and $5.205 billion representing year-over-year growth of 12% to 13%. Excluding pivotal and divestitures, our total revenue growth for 2013 is expected to be between 16% and 17%. Given our strong license revenue performance in the third quarter, license revenue for the full year is now expected to be within the range of $2.255 billion and $2.275 billion representing 8% to 9% growth as reported and 10% to 11% excluding pivotal and divestitures. In both cases, this represents an increase in the midpoint of guidance by approximately one half of a percentage point.
