    <body>Have you got a telephone directory? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/claudia-goldin-pharmacy-f2c2.pdf#pyramid&quot;&gt;goldin pharmacy &amp; medical supply&lt;/a&gt;  It&amp;#8217;ll be interesting to see Cohen&amp;#8217;s defense to these charges, but he has an uphill task ahead of him &amp;#8212; especially given that the hearing will be held in front of the SEC&amp;#8217;s own judge. The SEC has home-field advantage, here, while Cohen oversees a firm which has seen four different traders already plead guilty to criminal insider-trading charges. It&amp;#8217;s good that the SEC has finally managed to charge Cohen personally, rather than just his traders. The only pity is that we&amp;#8217;re still a long way from a criminal case. That might yet come, but I&amp;#8217;m not holding my breath.
