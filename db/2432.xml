In 2007, both types of loans had an equal interest rate of 6.8 percent, but a bill in Congress gradually reduced the subsidized rate, reaching 3.4 percent in 2011. Its aim was to make college more affordable and was to last until 2013, but the reduced rates were ended for budgetary reasons and the law&apos;s expiration was moved to 2012. Last June, it was extended one year in a compromise after President Barack Obama encouraged Congress to keep the lower rates.

By August 2012, spending on the contract was already close to that limit.
