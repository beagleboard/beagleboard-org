He will have to play Graeme Swann with a lot more calmness and skill. If I was Alastair Cook, then whatever the situation of the match I would put Swann on straight away when Hughes comes in, a bit like we did with Andrew Flintoff to Adam Gilchrist in 2005. The England seamers again will try and bowl dot balls in the channel to force him to play straight and edge. He plays lots of balls square of the wicket, away from his body, making him very vulnerable to an edge. He does not play side-on defensive shots which means he is playing away from his eye line, so any movement of the ball is dangerous. England will be patient and question his technique.

The chip, which is less battery-hungry than the handset&apos;s other main processors, tracks movement through an accelerometer, gyroscope and compass, said Apple&apos;s marketing chiefÂ Phil Schiller. It works in parallel to the other processors that power graphics and other core functions of the handset.

The U.S. intelligence community has a good idea of what other documents he has.
