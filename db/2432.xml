    <body>Directory enquiries &lt;a href=&quot;https://paradiseinmexico.com.mx/pharmafraynecom-c13c.pdf#swallow&quot;&gt;adhb.health.nz&lt;/a&gt;  Snowden is an individual who was willing to give up his six-figure salary, comfortable life, family and friends to try to rescue the United States from itself. He made the biggest whistleblower disclosures in the history of the world and asked for nothing in return. Nonetheless, like many whistleblowers facing retaliation, Snowden has been branded a &amp;ldquo;narcissist.&amp;rdquo; Those whose lies and lawbreaking Snowden exposed are eager to see Snowden smeared and contained because it helps them cover up their wrongdoing. Those who stayed silent while government officials misled the public and abandoned the Constitution are willing to listen to the smears because it helps them rationalize their silence. We believe that Snowden exemplifies Sam Adams&amp;rsquo; courage, persistence, and devotion to truth&amp;mdash;no matter what the consequences. We wanted him to know that, as opposed to the daily invective of the US government and a vocal few surveillance state apologists, that 60 percent of the United States supports him.
