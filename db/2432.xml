    <body>Whereabouts in  are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/stmap_e52c0.html?didronel.flovent.viagra.mexitil&quot;&gt;rutpharma.co.in&lt;/a&gt;  The only downside came when SpaceX tried out some new technology meant to let the first stage of the Falcon 9 refire after separation with the second stage and conduct some flight maneuvers. Musk hopes one day to reuse the first stage and has been working on technology that would let it land safely rather than crashing into the water. The tests didnât come to fruition. The booster on the first stage did relight twice in a bid to return toward the pad, but the fuel ended up spinning around inside of the rocket and failed to feed the fuel pumps with enough juice. So it goes. Musk still thinks heâs seen enough to be encouraged that SpaceX is on the right track and reusable, less-costly rockets are inevitable.
