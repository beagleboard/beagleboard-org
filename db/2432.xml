    <body>I&apos;d like to send this letter by  &lt;a href=&quot;https://oporajeyo.com/fertility-blend-bf45.pdf&quot;&gt;cheap fertility blend&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;All the texts I had with A-Rod and I got a lot of them from him and I texted him back they were all about his confidence,&amp;rdquo; Rose told Colin Cowherd. &amp;ldquo;For a guy making $25, 27 million a year, hitting 50 home runs, knocking in 120 runs, hitting .300, I never seen a guy that was so lack of confidence like he was. All he needs someone to do is pat him on the ass every damn time, [say] how good he is or how good he was.&amp;rdquo;
