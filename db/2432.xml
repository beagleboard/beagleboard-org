Unemployed American bus driver Ariel Castro appeared in court Thursday to faces charges that he kidnapped and raped three young women and held them in his home for a decade.The 52-year-old from Cleveland, Ohio did not enter a plea and stood with his head bowed while the court set a large bond of two million dollars per case, effectively ensuring that he will remain in detention. Castro&apos;s two brothers -- Pedro, 54, and Onil, 50 -- were also detained on Monday because they were with Ariel when he was arrested, but will not be charged in connection with the kidnapping.

Independent TV stations and newspapers have also enthusiastically backed the military and its crackdown on the Brotherhood, which included shutting down four Islamist TV stations. Their full-throated support reflects how convinced they became over Morsi&apos;s year that the Brotherhood were fundamentally anti-democratic and intertwined with violent extremists.
