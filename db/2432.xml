They&apos;ve lost elections they should have won because their candidates talked about &quot;legitimate rape&quot; and pregnancies from rape being a gift from God. They tried to make women undergo sonograms before getting an abortion, the implication being that women are just too stupid to understand what they are doing. Mind you, the men who proposed the idea are definitively pretty stupid when it comes to the details of basic human reproduction, since a sonogram at the early stages of pregnancy isn&apos;t the Hallmark commercial, jelly-on-the-belly test where the woman is happy to be pregnant and seeing her developing fetus on a monitor. It involves inserting a large plastic device into a woman&apos;s vagina &amp;ndash; a very invasive and even painful procedure; ask anyone who&apos;s had it. But of course, none of the men demanding the test have vaginas.
