The Maroon 5 frontman and the Victoria&apos;s Secret model have called it quits after two years together, their reps confirm. Levine, 33, first met the Russian-born model (also known as Anne V), 26, when his band performed at the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue release party in early 2010.

Microsoft has also backed promotion of a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; protocol that would discourage online ad targeting.
