In Europe, there was the specter of austerity and a euro zone breakup. In Japan, it was crushing debt and the Fukushima disaster. The United States had debt ceiling debacles, a fiscal cliff, sequester and poisonous political gridlock in Washington. But all along, we underestimated the resilience of developed markets as these crises all had less market impact than anticipated. The outlook is now less bleak throughout the developed world: Europe is still foundering, but the Eurozone survives intact and most of the crushing austerity is behind us. The U.S. is rebounding, and Japanâs Abenomics are a welcome surprise compared to the status quo. These developed governments have much more capacity to protect against chaos than was widely assumed.
