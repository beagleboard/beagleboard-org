    <body>The manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/deliver-lean-contact-9392.pdf&quot;&gt;deliver lean portal&lt;/a&gt;  Gene Cernan and Tom Stafford did not give a thought to a 12-year-old photographer named Scott Andrews in the early morning hours of June 3, 1966. The two astronauts had just strapped themselves into the cockpit of their Gemini 9 spacecraft â a tiny pod into which they were crammed shoulder-to-shoulder, nose-to-instrument panel, atop 109 ft. of Titan missile. Sometime that morning, massive tanks of aerozene 50 and nitrogen tetroxide would mix and explode in the belly of the Titan, producing an eruptive thrust of 430,000 lbs. and hurling the men into orbit. Two launch attempts had been scrubbed already, and for this third one, the back-up astronauts â Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin â had left a teasing little note in the cockpit: &amp;#8220;We were kidding before, but not anymore, get your&amp;#8230;uh&amp;#8230;selves into space, or we&amp;#8217;ll take your place.&amp;#8221;

It would be the boldest step in European integration since the crisis.

A study by financial analysis firm Sageworks found that profit per employee at privately held companies jumped to more than $18,000 in 2012 from about $14,000 in 2009.

A spokeswoman for the State Department said it has not yet transferred $585 million in military assistance and is scrutinizing &quot;a tiny bucket&quot; of economic aid to see if it should be curtailed but denied any decision to halt the funds.

Yet the number of mentally ill prisoners has risen, to 4,300 from 3,319, says Dora Schriro, commissioner of corrections for the city. That means the city&amp;#8217;s percentage of mentally ill prisoners grew from 24% to 37%.
