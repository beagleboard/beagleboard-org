    <body>Pleased to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/stmap_e0f90.html?viagra.tricor.nitrofurazone.famotidine&quot;&gt;florinef custo&lt;/a&gt;  But when it comes to the economy, the most alarming thing about Labourâs approach is not Milibandâs attempt to change the structure of it but Ed Ballsâs return to the Treasury. One might have expected Balls to enter into a period of quiet reflection following the return of boom and bust. But that would be fundamentally to misunderstand the shadow chancellor, the most bafflingly self-confident politician in recent British history. Balls believes that the crisis has vindicated his judgment. He is so enchanted with his 2010 Bloomberg speech on the economy, which cautioned against an early attempt to reduce the deficit, that he has been known to put parts of it to music when indulging his love of karaoke.
