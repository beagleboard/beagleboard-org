He said some patients were put in side rooms, which gave privacy but meant they were isolated, while open wards were not suitable.

(The same dynamic can be seen in the higher education market, where college tuition has outpaced inflation by a long shot.) The whole point of ObamaCare is to tweak the system so that insurers behave like normal companies in a capitalist framework &amp;mdash; and that tweak, more or less, is the individual mandate, which will encourage companies to compete for customers who aren&apos;t just young and healthy.
