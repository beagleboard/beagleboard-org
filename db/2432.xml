    <body>What do you like doing in your spare time? &lt;a href=&quot;http://teerandaz.com/stmap_131c0.html?erectafil.levitra.gyne-lotrimin.optivar&quot;&gt;esomeprazole pharmacy2us&lt;/a&gt;  I spent one day on my bike and one day in a car, reaching further afield. To the Twizel Bridge, for example, a handsome 90ft span across a Tweed tributary called the Till, which was finished not long before the battle and was used by the English baggage train while the men forded the river. At Heatherslaw, a former corn mill now converted into a number of energetic enterprises, the lady running the tea room was mulling over what battle-themed cakes she might be able to make. The bar is high; there&amp;rsquo;s already a Flodden Marmalade made with blood oranges. The mill is on the Ford &amp; Etal estate, as is the battlefield site, and the landowner, Lord Joicey, has been involved in the Ecomuseum from the start.
