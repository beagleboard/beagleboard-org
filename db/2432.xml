    <body>I work for myself &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoeydeutch.net/sjmedcom-house-raffle-8f08.pdf&quot;&gt;www.sjmed.com careers opportunities&lt;/a&gt;  Although the temporary absence of one of the jurors to a &quot;comfort break&quot; provided an opportunity for the rest of the panel to dump Tony Blair out of the Top 100 list altogether &amp;ndash; his messianic intervention on Syria had the precise opposite effect of what he had intended. Two old hands from the Blair/Brown era, either made a return or moved further up the list. Alistair Darling has been running a highly competent campaign against the separatists in Scotland, and whose steadying hand, many in Labour would like to see back centre stage. Even that old vaudeville act, Peter Mandelson made a sly return to the list, stirring up trouble and reaction wherever he appears. Lord Adonis remained the most influential Blairite on the list, as he steps up his bid to become Labour&amp;rsquo;s candidate for Mayor of London. Elsewhere, and with said juror still enjoying a &quot;comfort break&quot;, the cull of the old guard continued with Alastair Campbell, John Prescott and Gordon Brown disappearing from the list, along with the Telegraph&amp;rsquo;s own Dan Hodges. While his influence wasn&amp;rsquo;t questioned, his &quot;tribal loyalty to Labour&quot; was.
