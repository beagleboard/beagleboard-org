It&amp;rsquo;s designed to capture the true essence of the country by taking in the chic style of Milan, the classical sights of Rome and the Vatican, the Renaissance splendour of Florence and the storybook canals of Venice, as well as time in Lucca and Pisa. As a way of experiencing the country&amp;rsquo;s most celebrated cities and getting a true taste for Italian rail travel, it&amp;rsquo;s an unbeatable choice.

Classic car racer and aficionado, and Pink Floyd drummer, Nick Mason brings his wealth of experience once again &amp;ndash; along with his Ferrari 250 GTO for the RAC TT Celebration race. Another Revival regular is Rowan Atkinson, who is racing a Lotus-Cortina in the Whitsun Trophy event.
