    <body>I quite like cooking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/soul-sprout-nutrition-facts-9e88.pdf#disappointing&quot;&gt;soul sprout linkedin&lt;/a&gt;  When first running for President, Obama called for a $10 billion investment in a program that would provide states with grants to integrate programs supporting pregnant women and children from birth to five years old. The President raised the issue again during his State of the Union Address this year, this time calling for a tobacco tax increase to subsidize access to high quality Pre-K. Though the odds of raising the tax on tobacco are close to nil, the Administration&apos;s overhaul of Head Start (which for the first time calls for re-bidding the worst performing Head Start programs) and introduction of Early Learning Challenge Grants (which offer funds to states that are willing to upgrade their early childhood education systems) have already enhanced the quality of many early childhood education programs serving our neediest children. Here are four ways the administration can stretch the federal dollar to have an even greater impact on the national dialogue on this important topic.
