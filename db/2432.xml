Ed Miliband reshuffled him to his natural habitat as Shadow Health Secretary, a job which he held in the last year of Brown&amp;rsquo;s government. He performed well in responding to the Hillsborough report. Despite a falling out with Ed Miliband he survived being axed, which has only gone on to strengthen the Burnham brand. He has a growing group of supporters among MPs and is on good terms with the unions. If 2015 does not go to plan, we could see Burnham stand again for the leadership.

Monahan scored in his fourth straight game when he took a cross-ice feed from Sven Baertschi and buried it behind Martin Brodeur.
