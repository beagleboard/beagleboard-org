My son Mateo is 14, a big David Wright fan and an athlete. David gave him all kinds of advice, especially that the day you donât feel like working out is the day you work twice as hard. He was as interested in us as we were in him. He was a very humble, very gracious man. I was amazed that heâd even invited us.â
