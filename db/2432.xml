The Facebook spokesperson said, however, that the company is attempting to figure out the best way to give people control over the types of content they find on Facebook.

Once again, he had failed to crack Froome and, even though he moved into second place overall 4min 34sec behind the Briton after Bauke Mollema&amp;rsquo;s nightmare trial lost him over two minutes, he and his Saxo-Tinkoff team will not stop trying to rattle the leader.

Year-round, you can take a three-hour daytime or moonlit tour; alas, the two October ghost tours are already sold out for 2013. (Info: 831/625-4419. Moonlight tours: $20 for adults; $10 for kids ages 6-17; free for kids 5 and under.)
