Sometimes these policies are doing little more than subsidizing waste because of an inherent lack of planning behind the incentives. Germany doesn&apos;t have the energy storage or smart grid technologies in place to capture the intermittent energy created by wind, solar and other renewables. So when the German grid produces too much electricity, wind turbines shut down and consumers pay for the energy they could theoretically produce. When the grid produces too little, some German factories shut down and consumers pay for the lost profits industry could have earned were it allowed to operate. Not only that, but the most expensive clean energy technologies in Germany also receive the highest subsidies, so German consumers pay more than necessary to access clean energy.
