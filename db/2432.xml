His eyes seem to glint even bluer when I tell him this. He says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from my life experience. I think I was much less charismatic before.&amp;rdquo; Rush portrays the young Lauda as very determined, practical and pragmatic. His personality was the opposite of the flamboyant catnip to all women, James Hunt. Actor Daniel Brühl, who played Lauda, had to have prosthetic teeth. He was known as &amp;ldquo;The Rat&amp;rdquo; for his protruding teeth, which you don&amp;rsquo;t notice now.

With playing its all about timing and placement of the hit. Last year I watched Kam Chancellor of Seattle lay out Vernon Davis of San Francisco with a vicious and CLEAN hit. How much bigger is VD than KC? While the effect of the play was VD sitting out with a concussion I&amp;#8217;d argue that that is preferable to ending ones career. A well placed and timed hit on Keller would&amp;#8217;ve been enough.
