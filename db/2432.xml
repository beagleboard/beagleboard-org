The harder path lies in confronting the cognitive dissonance presented by the facts of black life in America. African-Americans are forced to face them every day. On one level we must tolerate a certain cognitive dissonance, holding opposing facts in our head about promise and peril in America for people with dark skin. At another level, we must try to resolve that dissonance not by erasing facts that are disturbing but by doing the hard work required to make America better. That was the message of Martin Luther King&apos;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. America is exceptional in its promise and it is our job to make her live up to that promise.
