    <body>Looking for a job &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/stark-medical-supplies-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;stark medical law&lt;/a&gt;  The solution is fairly simple. Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, is planning a British Bill of Rights that would be senior to any jurisdiction from Strasbourg. We have never, before, needed a constitution &amp;ndash; such basic principles as press freedom have been taken for granted. When the Scottish Parliament was granted powers to regulate television, the press was not mentioned: as recently as the late 1990s it was unthinkable that this old liberty would be extinguished. Yet next week, the Privy Council will consider government plans to do just that.
