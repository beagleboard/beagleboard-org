The trial differed from some earlier trials with new oral anticoagulants in that patients were treated following a lead-in period with heparin. In addition, patients were treated for as short as three months or as long as a year at the discretion of the physician, though patients were followed for a full year. Patients with low body weight or renal impairment received a half dose of edoxaban. The investigators said the design was intended to reflect the full spectrum of conditions clinicians see in real life.
