No one need be reminded that Woods has won all 14 of his Grand Slam titles â second to Jack Nicklausâ 18 â with at least a share of the 54-hole lead, which was within his grasp down the stretch Saturday. But a bogey on No. 17 sandwiched by two missed birdie putts on 16 and 18 left Woods with a 1-over round of 72. Westwood, sinking putts like he never has before in his career, shot 70, then said, âI didnât feel any pressure out there.â
