These are the people who have been doing it for years &amp;ndash; they are not the bigwigs you read about in the papers, but the tried and trusted professionals who are responsible for everything from laying cables to vision mixing, from supplying presenters with research notes to giving instructions in their ear while the programme is under way. Their skills are legendary and their experience immeasurable.
