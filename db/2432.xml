    <body>It&apos;s a bad line &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/genoxoncom-a6a4.pdf&quot;&gt;genoxon.com review&lt;/a&gt;  Myth number two offered up by Ms Powell was that more childcare will &amp;ldquo;narrow the gap between the most vulnerable children and their peers&amp;rdquo;. There is no evidence to support this. In fact, Sure Start was evaluated by the Department of Education in December 2010. It found that although there were benefits to parental behaviour &quot;only in the case of physical health did children directly benefit&quot;. There was no discernible effect to &quot;school readiness&quot; as measured by the Early Years Foundation Stage.
