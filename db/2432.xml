    <body>Have you got any experience? &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/australian-testosterone-enanthate-bladders-e52c.pdf#accommodate&quot;&gt;australian testosterone enanthate bladders&lt;/a&gt;  This is something I&apos;ve been personally very exercised about since the start of the prosecution against Manning more than three years ago. It&apos;s one thing for a government to go after an official leaker - that is only to be expected and any government needs to police some degree of containment of its classified intelligence. But it is the manner in which this is being done - with a ruthlessness, a vengeance - that is disturbing. To say they are throwing the book at Manning is a woeful understatement of what&apos;s happening here. They are attempting to destroy him. And I&apos;m convinced that is not because they have strong feelings about Manning himself - this is not really about him. It&apos;s about sending an almighty chill through the entire system of government so that nobody dares to repeat what he did. Look at Edward Snowden. He has torn up his entire life in the US, expecting never to return home, largely because he saw what happened to Manning and on the back of it concluded he would never face a fair trial in the US. Now, Snowden was brave enough to still go ahead with whistleblowing over a matter he believed to be hugely in the US public interest. Will anyone else display such courage, particularly after Manning&apos;s sentence comes down, and if they don&apos;t, what does that mean for US free speech and the essential roll of journalism in holding power to account?
