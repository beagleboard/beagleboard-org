He said that if the department has to absorb another $52 billion in cuts next year because of the federal sequester, there will likely be layoffs instead of furloughs. (AP Photo/Bruce Smith)

Not exactly an Anderson hater, but was begging for the belt to change and so happy you went out there and did it. Being from such a good wrestling background, what led you to getting into MMA (after college I&apos;m presuming)?
