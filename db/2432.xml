If you slowly turn down the driving voltage of one LTP (which has the object) while slowly turning up the voltage of an adjacent LTP, you can horizontally move the sample and even pass it between levitators. &quot;If you can do this using two levitators, you can think about having a line of them and produce planar motion.&quot;

The images they capture will then be digitally processed to account for the structure&amp;#8217;s shape and beamed out the other side across 1,500 LED strips. The facade was designed with pedestrians in mind&amp;#8211;the arrangement of the cameras and LEDs is based on the precise angles from various viewing points around Incheon&amp;#8217;s Cheongna district, about 20 miles west of Seoul, where the building will sit. The effect would only be activated for a few hours a day, when weather conditions permitted&amp;#8211;the lights inside the 450-meter tall tower make after-hours invisibility impossible.
