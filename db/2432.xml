But some 90 per cent of its population live on less than two dollars a day.

Long term stability should be the goal in any economy, not carelessly overheating it to fill the pockets of the few. All the fear mongers out there already propagating gloom and doom, which in turn could in a sense, become a self fulfilling prophecy. How about promoting that the Chinese leadership is thinking 20 years ahead of all the greedy partakers of China&amp;#8217;s expansion?? Stability&amp;#8230;.Look at it this way. China can grow at 15% for five years or 5% for 15 years. Which is the more stable model?? I want to hear that China is still growing in 20-30 years, not that it overheated and crashed in 5!! A steady model is what the Chinese leaders are after and it is wise for them&amp;#8211;maybe not Silicon Valley but that&amp;#8217;s just too bad.
