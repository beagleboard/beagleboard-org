Two centuries ago, reformers were disturbed to find large numbers of the mentally ill in jails, paving the way for the development of state-run institutions. In the 1950s and 1960s, complaints about abuses, advances in medication and a push to give the patients more independence led to another change, this time toward community settings. The weaknesses of that conceptâa lack of facilities, barriers created by privacy laws and tightened local and state fundingâhas brought the picture full circle.

Over at the Premier League, the iron first is coming down on this kind of attention seeking. The other elite referees have turned on those who regard officiating as a good way to cultivate celebrity friendships: to be part of football&amp;rsquo;s Hollywood production, rather than law-enforcers, which is all they really are (or should be).
