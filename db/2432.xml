It tends to happen to most clematis at this time of year. The lower leaves become a bit of an irrelevance once the plant has put all its energy into clambering upwards to flower. In their natural state clematis would be clambering other plants to get aloft and they generally look a little ill at ease when they are simply planted against a fence and expected to get on with it. I strongly suggest that you plant a shrub (possibly an evergreen or evergreen-and-white) in front of it or close by and allow the clematis to wander into it. The lower leaves will still go brown, but being hidden by the host plant, they very probably won&amp;rsquo;t worry you so much.
