The key benefit to TextureCam lies in its ability to assimilate information about its terrain, on the fly, without needing input from ground control teams. Existing rovers, including Curiosity, which is currently exploring Mars, have the capacity to differentiate between certain materials within its environment; however, these technologies also rely upon beaming back this data to Earth, so further analysis can be performed. TextureCam will not be limited by these hurdles, saving precious time.
