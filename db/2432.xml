    <body>Your account&apos;s overdrawn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/chocxo-coffee-menu-b01a.pdf&quot;&gt;chocxo dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;  Its a true shame. Our President has his head in the clouds, or up his ass too far to realize that the American people no longer want to buy into his lies. I Personally don&amp;#8217;t want congress to cut his another blank check with no system in place to start reducing our national debt. I also don&amp;#8217;t want to watch millions of my fellow Americans fall into repressive amounts of debt due to being FORCED to pay for health insurance. Most Americans can&amp;#8217;t even afford a new car, but Obama seems to think we can all afford to pay as much for Health insurance. Also, if Obamacare is so great for America, why is it that Obama and members of congress will not opt in on their own sham of a law? A Law which is technically illegal since congress shall not pass any law on the American people that it will not pass on itself, but oops lets forget that while we are cramming this BS down the American people&amp;#8217;s throats.
