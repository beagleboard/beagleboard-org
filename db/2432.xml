In three preseason games, he has 16 assists and only one turnover. Turner, Young and Hawes gave no indication that they give any less than what is expected of them, and Anderson is showing a real knack for getting the ball to the rim. As fast as the pace was, Tony Wroten was still a step ahead of it off the bench, and Lavoy Allen did a good job of rebounding (nine in 16 minutes), though his conditioning still appears to be nowhere close to prime.
