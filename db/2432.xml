The prospect of a vaccine is therefore exciting to patients and health experts alike. But developing one is difficult. Malarial parasites, though small and single-celled, are much more complex than the bacteria and viruses that are the usual targets of vaccines. To date there has been no successful vaccine against such a complex organism. Work on RTS,S has been going on for decades.

Like the famous TV song goes, &quot;You want to go where everyone knows your name.&quot; If policy efforts to move the unbanked to banks are to be successful in the long run, banks need to remember they are a service industry involved in one of society&amp;rsquo;s most important and basic relationships.

The process will eliminate the need for gas compression, or maintenance of the unit, it says. GE aims to sell the unit at $500 retail, about a tenth of the cost of current models.
