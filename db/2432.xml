    <body>I need to charge up my phone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/minasmedicalcombr-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;buymeds4pets.com&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;The Government may be keen for property prices to keep on rising but this will be a long, slow recovery. Much ground has been lost and transactions and lending levels are running at a fraction of what they were at the height of the housing boom. While it&apos;s useful to keep an eye on official numbers, ultimately it&apos;s about the buyer making their own call. Don&apos;t be too swayed by the fact that indices tell us prices are rising and end up panic buying in case you are priced out further. The buyer has to pay the mortgage and need to ensure they can afford it before taking the plunge.&quot;
