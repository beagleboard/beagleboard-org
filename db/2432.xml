    <body>I live here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/wwwpolpharmatv-5884.pdf#automatically&quot;&gt;www.dmd.medicines.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;  On the other side of this radio road are the Mets, unceremoniously dumped by WFAN, the station that owned the teamâs broadcast rights all the way back to the 1980s when its call letters were WHN. Anyone already believing there is no loyalty in this business now has eight legs to stand on.

Unless thereâs breaking news on the investigation prior to, or during, the game, donât expect the voices to go near the subject.

If Wiesel had simply sold 180 tickets at $9,300 each, then only $7,800 of each ticket would have been tax deductible, since each of the scavenger hunters received $1,500 (!) in scavenger-hunt value over the course of their sleepless night. Instead, under Wiesel&amp;#8217;s structure, the full $1.67 million ended up being fully tax-deductible.

But, maybe there is little advantage to this. What I have now is using the Windows XP operating system and MSN Internet Explorer for Internet and email functions. If there is a benefit to using one manufacturer, it would be helpful to know that. Does it make any difference if it is Android vs. an iPhone. -- Ray Freer
