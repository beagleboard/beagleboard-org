When Sanchez was a rookie, he used to attend Ryanâs son Sethâs high school football games on Friday night. But Ryan should feel really guilty about sending Sanchez onto the field in the fourth quarter of the preseason game against the Giants behind a patchwork offensive line. Geno Smith had taken every snap up to that point. There was nothing to be gained by putting in Sanchez other than trying to win the Snoopy Bowl and there was an awful lot to lose. Sanchez lost his season to a torn labrum. It was a reckless decision by Rex, who otherwise is a compassionate coach, which is why his players love him.
