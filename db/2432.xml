Captain William Robinson, who served for 47 years and died here, is said to pace around the building and even do some occasional dusting. The lighthouse is open for visits June-October. (Info: 231/894-8265. Admission: $4 for adults; $2 for kids ages 2-12; free for kids under 2.)

The Seminoles in 1999 and Trojans on &apos;04 are the only teams to go wire-to-wire as No. 1 from preseason to final poll.

The company has yet to release the product to the public. But when it does, Glass may have a more subtle design.

Itâs impossible to tell, but itâs not far-fetched to think that the Nets are in much better shape than the Knicks, whose offseason has been a dud compared to what has been happening over in Atlantic Yards.
