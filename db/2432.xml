Perhaps inevitably, a romantic element has been added as a sidebar. Martin and Claudia had a love affair several years ago that ended badly, so they go into the case wary of each other as well as of the government bigwigs who are trying to manipulate them in order to insure a guilty verdict. As the two attorneys meet the prisoner and begin to pursue the case for the defense, they become convinced that the government is hiding something. Martin&amp;rsquo;s predecessor on the case ended up dead, reportedly a suicide but perhaps a victim of foul play. Soon their own lives are in jeopardy as they uncover a conspiracy in high places.
