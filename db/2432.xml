Between 2009 and 2010, just after the line was upgraded, passenger miles jumped by 20%. That growth has not been sustained. Between 2011 and 2012 passenger miles increased by 4.6%; between 2012 and 2013 they edged up just 0.9%. The future path of growth âis the great betâ, says Arthur Leathley of Virgin Rail, which runs the lineâin other words, it is uncertain.
