Double schadenfreude and, I must admit, rather a surprise. Completion date has now been put back to 2016.And surprise was to become a recurring feature of my stay in Hamburg. Carls, the restaurant where I dined on that first evening, is in a modern European office building. But inside is a delightful French brasserie with impressive views over the industrial harbour.
