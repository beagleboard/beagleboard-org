But people running the largest U.S. financial firms managed to get the rules changed from the 1980s and, as a result, their firms bulked up and greatly expanded their range of activities during the big credit boom that led to the crisis of 2008. Today&apos;s behemoths are those that became even bigger as a result of the bailouts and other forms of government support they received during that crisis.
