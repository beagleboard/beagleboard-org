After encounters with Chinese MiG 15s, he considered the Meteor outclassed in air-to-air combat and suggested it would be better used in the ground-attack role. This view did not go down well in some quarters or with some of his pilots. His Chief of Air Staff supported him, however &amp;mdash; only for the aircraft to be given a role escorting bomber formations. Soon after Steege left, the squadron was reassigned to ground-attack missions.
