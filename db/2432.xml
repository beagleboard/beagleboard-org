Love to see the criminals sue each other for lying to each other! Does anyone, I mean ANYONE, not know that banks today are nothing more than continuing criminal enterprises protected by the ones they own in Congress, etc.? Big banks are the bane of the world, there is no doubt. Do you need a list of their latest crimes for which there will be no meaningful punishment?
