    <body>How many more years do you have to go? &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/goglobaltravelhealthcouk-5522.pdf#wheat&quot;&gt;1800medicine.com&lt;/a&gt;  The turnaround appeared to begin just before race six, when Oracle was down 4-1 and used its single &quot;postponement card&quot; to take a 47-hour timeout to overhaul its boat, crew and training regimen. It started tweaking its boat each night - when it was hauled out of the water and the 135-foot wing was removed - and practicing on rest days, which New Zealand did not appear to do, or need to do. It returned to the race course each day with improved speed and crew work.
