Many have seen the events of the Arab Spring as involving a popular movement for democracy against autocratic government, and to some extent this is true. But one thing that has been very noticeable, especially in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, has been the emergence of democratically elected governments that have no time for opinions other than their own.

For one, Berlo will not serve any real jail time. For another, it finally gives his opponents some vindication and shuts them up. Also, this conviction allows him to play the victim, without really being victimized much. It gives his party a boost and a rallying cry. All in all, this conviction is probably the best thing that has happened to Berlo right now. And I think he knows it and is milking it for what it&amp;#8217;s worth. Berlo is one of the shrewdest, savviest politician Europe has ever known.
