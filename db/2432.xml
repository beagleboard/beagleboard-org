    <body>A pension scheme &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/the-pharmacy-shoppe-lexington-ky-bac9.pdf#recruit&quot;&gt;the pharmacy shoppe casey il&lt;/a&gt;  Maggie Oldham, chief executive at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: &quot;We accept the findings of the Health and Safety Executive&apos;s investigation. Our thoughts remain with the family of Gillian Astbury and we apologise for the appalling care Ms Astbury received at our hospital in April 2007. Ms Astbury&apos;s death was reported as a serious untoward incident at the time and a full investigation into her care and treatment was carried out. The recommendations from that investigation were implemented. Actions included raising staff awareness about the care of diabetic patients and improving the information system for nurse handovers. In 2010 we reviewed Ms Astbury&apos;s dreadful care and, as a result, disciplinary action was taken.&quot;
