    <body>This is your employment contract &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casadeadoracao.com.br/index.php/enerex-reviews--bac9.pdf#monument&quot;&gt;enerex cost&lt;/a&gt;  The way Fink tells it, it seems that some doctors and nurses at Memorial administered heavy doses of morphine or the sedative midazolam, or both, to gravely ill patients, possibly to ease their fear and pain, but probably also to hasten their deaths. As more than one nurse remarks, this is not unheard-of in medicine-as-usual, although it is rarely acknowledged. It also seems likely that the doctors felt the patients wouldn&amp;#8217;t survive the evacuation and that in one case the remaining staff would be physically incapable of carrying a 300-pound-plus man out of the building. Others suspected, correctly, that evacuated patients would be taken to a place where they&amp;#8217;d have access to no care at all. (Initially some medical evacuees were taken to hospitals, but in order to keep the helicopters in steady rotation over the flooded areas, many were dropped at SARBOOs &amp;#8212; search-and-rescue bases of operations &amp;#8212; where the ambulances that were supposed to pick them up failed to materialize. One Memorial doctor watched other physician&amp;#8217;s patients moaning and dying around him in an open airport concourse after weeping, overwhelmed relief workers ran out of supplies in less than a day.)

But that&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s happening.&amp;#8221;
