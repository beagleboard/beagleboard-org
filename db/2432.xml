Our family matters more than anything &amp;mdash; and I mean anything. At the Oscars [which he hosted in 2009], when I put my hand on my heart, that&amp;rsquo;s a sign to Debs out there, a reminder that this is what matters and that all the rest &amp;mdash; the awards and the money and the fame &amp;mdash; may come and go.

Her gaze is remarkably unflinching; unnervous, but not stern. She concentrates on looking at all times. She is difficult to interview, but for reasons much more prosaic than the dramatic ones I had conjured. She simply finds herself uninteresting, and so gives away little. You feel there is much more to know, and that the failure must lie in your ability to ask about it.
