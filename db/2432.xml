A decade after the Christmastime slaying of JonBenet Ramsey, two aspects of the case endure: the public&apos;s endless fascination with the murder of the 6-year-old beauty contestant, and a sense the notorious crime may never be solved.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/lioresal-kopen-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;lioresal precio mexico&lt;/a&gt;  But the latest chapter in the saga, involving Silicon Valley, begins in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, when Hayden and other senior NSA officials, including his predecessor, Ken Minihan, were in a state of near-panic. Not only had the Soviet Unionâthe chief object of the NSAâs spying, and its raison dâetreâdisappeared from the map, but now the agency also realized that the main threat was going to be âsuper-empoweredâ individualsâterroristsâwho might be talking on cell phones or computers anywhere on earth. Above all, these new bad guys were using private technology, rather than the sort of intra-government communications systems that the NSA used to monitor in the Soviet Union or China. Not by coincidence, during the Cold War, the NSA often had the biggest hand in designing its own detection equipment. âWe were Americaâs Information Age enterprise during Americaâs Industrial Age. We had the habit of saying, âIf we need it, weâre going to have to build it,â â Hayden says. âBut in the outside world, there was a technological explosion in the two universes that had been at the birth of the agency almost uniquely ours: telecommunications and computers. The Internet began as a combination of those twoâyou could probably draw a good history as to what we did to create the American computing industry back in the â50s.â
