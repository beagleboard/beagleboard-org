IUDs were taking a horrible toll on U.S. forces and contractors, especially the long trains of trucks hauling fuel, munitions and supplies for troops. The ability to create a convoy of driverless supply trucks, as well as assault vehicles and ambulances, was very appealing. So in 2005, DARPA launched the Grand Challenge, a university competition to build the first autonomous -- as opposed to remotely controlled -- vehicle to drive 100 miles across a desert proving grounds. That work directly led to the development of most of todayâs self-driving cars, including Google, Audi, and Nissan.
