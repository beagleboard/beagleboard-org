    <body>What&apos;s the exchange rate for euros? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/markeaton-pharmacy-b01a.pdf&quot;&gt;markeaton pharmacy kedleston road&lt;/a&gt;  John Liu says he wants to get rid of the policy. The other Democrats want to modify it. Why? Because it sounds good to say that. They must all think it plays well to the editorial board of the New York Times, or to the Rev. Al of MSNBC.

However, it also wonât add to the harm done by drugs the way incarcerating users and forcing them to rely on the vagaries of the black market does.
