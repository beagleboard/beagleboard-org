    <body>Do you know what extension he&apos;s on? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/cosmetology-clinic-names-ab8a.pdf&quot;&gt;cosmetology clinic names&lt;/a&gt;  German&amp;#8217;s opinion is not unique or heretical in the E.V. sector, which raises the question of why so much money was invested in the industry before batteries became cheap and powerful enough to compete with gasoline engines. One culprit could be the California mandate for zero-emissions vehicles: in 1990, the state required that, by 1998, two per cent of vehicles made by large manufacturers and sold in California be free of emissions, and that, by 2003, that proportion rise to ten per cent. (The state later scaled back those requirements.) One analyst I spoke to, who asked not to be identified, told me that because California is such a big market the requirements encouraged auto manufacturers to roll out E.V.s to meet the state&amp;#8217;s regulations before the cars would appeal to a wide market. The combination of state-mandated sales targets and low consumer demand has forced manufacturers to reduce the price of their E.V.s and sell them at a loss.
