This was most noticeable in the dour and tormented story of GTA IV, which had the player take control of a Serbian war criminal trying to go straight in New York. &amp;ldquo;I think one problem Rockstar has had,&amp;rdquo; Kushner observes, &amp;ldquo;is that they&amp;rsquo;ve always been trying to be film-makers. If you look at the titles they give themselves, like &amp;lsquo;executive producer&amp;rsquo;, and their trailers, in a way it can seem like the work of frustrated film-makers. With GTA IV there was a feeling of trying too hard, of being serious despite all the humour.&amp;rdquo;
