This was recreated from the television series âLongstreetâ, in which Lee played the protagonist &amp;#8211; a martial arts teacher who tries to teach his student the principles of Jeet Kune Do, a form of martial arts that Bruce Lee himself created: âEmpty your mind, be formless, shapeless like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.â The advert is based around these famous lines, using the theme of the power of water as a metaphor for the glory and stature of the icon.
