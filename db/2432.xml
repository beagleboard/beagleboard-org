A report prepared for the Regents&apos; Committee on Grounds and Buildings states they considered buying another house for that purpose this year, but were unable to locate one under $5 million. What&apos;s more, selling Blake House is complicated because its 10-acres of gardens were donated to the Berkeley campus to train future landscape architects.
