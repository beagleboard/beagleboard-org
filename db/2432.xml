    <body>The manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/wankul-3c56.pdf&quot;&gt;wankumbu&lt;/a&gt;  Here we have an elected official battling desperately to bring development to an underdeveloped section of D.C., and her colleagues on the city council undermining those efforts for political gain. The members who voted for the living wage bill, and the activists who pushed for it, have told Alexander&apos;s constituents they should not have the right to decide how much money they&apos;re willing to work for. They have decided on behalf of struggling Ward 7 residents that no job at $12.50 an hour is better than a job at &quot;only&quot; $8.25. This is paternalism in its most immoral and destructive formulation.
