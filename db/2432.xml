    <body>I&apos;d like to apply for this job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/medi-jobsde-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;medi-jobs.de&lt;/a&gt;  Colorado Springs is the state&apos;s second-largest city and has medical marijuana, but the city council recently voted 5-4 to opt out of allowing retail stores as well as facilities for cultivation, manufacturing or testing.Â Don Knight, a councilman who voted with the majority, explained that potential tax revenue was not enough to justify other likely losses. &quot;The input of $3.9 million that recreational marijuana would have given us, compared to the loss of tens of millions dollars, in either military or tourism, just didn&apos;t provide a balance sheet to me,&quot; he said.
