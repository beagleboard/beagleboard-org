The car will launch in America with three engines, including the magnificent 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine in the 428i model, developing 245 hp and 350 Nm (258 lb-ft) of torque. Itâll enable this four-seater convertible to go from 0 to 60 in 6.4 seconds while returning up to 34 mpg. You can get either a six-speed manual, or the renowned 8-speed ZF automatic. The 428i Convertible will be offered with a choice of rear-wheel drive or with optional xDrive, BMWâs intelligent all-wheel drive system, while the 435i Convertible will be available at launch with rear wheel drive.
