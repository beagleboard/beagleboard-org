If (Thornton) goes broad or into another realm that seems not real, it is real because he comes from that. His mother was a clairvoyant, she took his readings. It&apos;s his own niche in the southern culture. Very definitely Hollywood, they miss it because they put quotations around it and they condescend to it. But he speaks from within out, because he understands it. So whatever he portrays is accurate to what he comes from, which may be different from other parts of the South. But he doesn&apos;t misconstrue it, he understands it where most Hollywood movies do not.

Bush, who rarely wades into policy debates, gave a boost to efforts in Congress. While the two-term Republican president did not embrace any particular bill, he said he hoped there would be a &quot;positive resolution.&quot;

No one knows whether it predicts or measures readiness for college or careers. No one can explain why all 8-year-old students in America should be tested to see if they are on a path for college. As for careers, most of them probably want to be cowboys or police officers or astronauts.
