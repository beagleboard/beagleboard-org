This was the first time since records began in 1905 that the temperature had hit 100 or more for 3 consecutive days. Providence, Rhode Island recorded a searing 102 degrees to set a new record high temperature for July for the state. Also, this was the second day in a row of 100 degree readings, an extremely rare event for the location.
