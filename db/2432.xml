The former WWE diva joined the crowds of people flocking to this year&apos;s Burning Man Festival, an annual hippie extravaganza celebrating art, music and self-expression, for an experience she&apos;ll never forget. &quot;#BurningMan #Lifechanging,&quot; she simply tweeted on Sept. 2, posting a stunning photo of herself posing alongside a massive art installation set up in the desert (l.). &quot;Best #sunrise ever.&quot; she tweeted later, adding another shot of herself dressed in a boho-chic long coat and headband.

A two-alarm fire last week at a home in Piedmont, Calif., prompted Piedmont Fire Chief Warren McLaren to say the technology âabsolutelyâ made it harder on firefighters. Weeks earlier, in Delanco, N.J., more than 7,000 solar panels on the roof of a massive 300,000-square foot warehouse factored into Delanco Fire Chief Ron Holtâs refusal to send his firefighters onto the roof of a Dietz &amp; Watson facility.

It&amp;#8217;s total hypocrisy. This is a coup by any standards. I&amp;#8217;m an atheist and I don&amp;#8217;t support much of what Mursi stands for or has done, but he was elected by a majority in a fair election and he should be able to serve out his term. So much for our democratic principles: but then we are not democracies are we &amp;#8211; our system is monopoly capitalism and our politicians are subservient to the mega-rich. Look at Tony Blair supporting the Egyptian army, what a sell-out he is.
