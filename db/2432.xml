Itâs an odd question to pose, but itâs reasonable to ask since he has so often been hurt by comparisons to the leagueâs top players â especially James. But Anthony had a breakout year last season, leading the league in scoring with 28.7 points per game and driving the Knicks to its first playoff series win in 13 years. While he may never quiet those who claim he shoots too much, Anthony has evolved as a player, slimming down and paying more attention to defense. Even so, he will have to be even better this season, with the Eastern Conference stronger and the Nets reloading. Extra attention will be paid to Anthony to see if he can sustain the Knicksâ success. And that means being able to co-exist with Bargnani and World Peace while also making sure that players such as Smith and Iman Shumpert continue to grow. After all, the Knicksâ best player is supposed to make those around him better.

The JOBS Act allows companies like Twitter to file a draft IPO prospectus confidentially, so long as they currently have less than $1 billion in annual revenue. Then, the law permits those companies to propose their share price as little as three weeks after revealing their filing. If Twitter reveals its listing documents this week, they could even make this move before Halloween.
