    <body>How many weeks&apos; holiday a year are there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/testoforce-and-xength-in-canada-92e2.pdf&quot;&gt;xength x1 canada&lt;/a&gt;  We all pay for public education, because it&amp;#8217;s a public good. Private education, meanwhile, is a private good, which is rightly paid for with after-tax income. California is now developing an intermediate model &amp;#8212; what the Hillsborough Schools Foundation likes to call &amp;#8220;a groundbreaking public-private partnership to support our schools&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;d like to think that the the intermediate model, at the margin, might slowly replace the old binary model, and result in wealthy parents being more involved in their local public schools, and less likely to opt out entirely by sending their kids to private school. And that, in turn, would be good for everybody.
