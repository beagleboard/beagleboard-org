Wendy Davis and a bevy of protesters successfully filibustered the bill last month, but Republican Gov. Rick Perry called another special session so Republican lawmakers could vote on the bill again.

The actor has reportedly signed on for multiple movies. Warner Bros plans a Justice League film featuring Superman alongside Batman, Wonder Woman and various lesser known heroes, once Man of Steel 2 is out of the way.
