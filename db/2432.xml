The gang rape that seemed to end Lovelace&apos;s marriage in the new film was actually what kicked off Traynor&apos;s abusive extremes in their relationship. Her body was his currency &amp;mdash; as a source of income and a means of payment; he even allegedly pimped her out to a doctor to pay for the silicone breast injections he wanted her to have. Prostitution then paved the way for 8-millimeter smut films, as Traynor forced her into increasingly taboo scenarios that culminated with her infamous short, &quot;Dogarama.&quot;
