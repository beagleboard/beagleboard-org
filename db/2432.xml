The carrier seems to have done a fine job with the iPhone, using it effectively to bring aboard high quality postpaid subscribers from rival platforms and bolster ARPU levels. The 1.4 million iPhones sold in Q2 may have been 7% lower than what Sprint managed last year, but almost 41% of these sales went to new customers. The introduction of the iPhone at T-mobile may have been responsible for the y-o-y iPhone sales decline, but Sprint Â has assuaged concerns by saying that it is still well ahead of its volume commitment targets. The growing number of iPhone postpaid subscribers is helping push up Sprint&amp;#8217;s overall postpaid ARPUs which rose by about 1% y-o-y to a record $64.20 last quarter. Driven by increasing smartphone penetration, we expect Sprint&amp;#8217;s postpaid ARPUs to continue to grow in the coming quarters, but at slower rates than last year.
