    <body>I&apos;d like to transfer some money to this account &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/stmap_55220.html?ranitidine.cataflam.elocon.viagra&quot;&gt;generic estradiol tablets&lt;/a&gt;  There was, however, one hitch. Since the Wisconsin Education Association never asked for the power of collective bargaining, the association&apos;s leadership was clueless on how to leverage it after the Municipal Employee Relations Act became law. (Note: for the politically astute, the Municipal Employee Relations Act of 1959 was the law Governor Scott Walker contentiously scaled back in 2011, an unpopular move that forced him to face a recall election that he won in 2012).
