When President Clinton left office in 2001, we were paying down the national debt at the rate of several hundred billions of dollars a year with budget surpluses. Since that time the Bush administration moved the United States substantially into budget deficits with large tax cuts, major military commitments to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a new prescription drug entitlement â all undertaken without offsetting expenditure reduction or increasing revenue. Beyond these decisions, the largest factor in the current level of deficits is the worst economic downturn since the Depression â a downturn that began under President Bush. People will debate the merits of President Obama&amp;#8217;s stimulus measures â though I think their positive effect on growth and employment is quite clear â but this debate matters little. Government employment has been contracting, and the debate over stimulus has largely faded.
