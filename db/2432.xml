    <body>I&apos;d like to apply for this job &lt;a href=&quot;https://contactconsultoria.com/index.php/crowdmedcom-a511.pdf&quot;&gt;crowdmed.com&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;Lots of companies were interested in sponsoring the kitchen,&amp;rdquo; says Dragset. &amp;ldquo;But nobody was offering quite what we wanted. We have tried to represent the developments we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the city, both in taste and also in who&amp;rsquo;s living here,&amp;rdquo; he adds. &amp;ldquo;Many of the old families have had to move out, and new groups of people have moved in. You hear about new developments that cost £10-20&amp;thinsp;million, where 10 per cent of the cost is artwork. You can even buy taste off the shelf: £1&amp;thinsp;million worth of art, and it&amp;rsquo;s all chosen for you. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think about.&amp;rdquo;
