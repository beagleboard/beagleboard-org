Itâs widely assumed that âeasyâ money drove a U.S. housing boom, but then basic economics tells us that artificially low rates donât constitute easy money. Greenspanâs numerous critics add that low rates were aided by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Community Reinvestment Act and mortgage interest deductions, and while all of them are an abomination, it must be remembered that the housing boom was global in nature, and occurred in places where rates were much higher, where Fannie/Freddie didnât exist, where there are no mortgage interest deductions, and where a home loan is frequently very difficult to attain. Greenspan himself has pointed all of this out, but his voice has been drowned out by an often emotional echo chamber.

Â There are 233 Republicans in the house. Â With somewhere between 30-70 of these members being teapartiers, that should leave Boehner 160-200 members to work with along with Democrats to pass the bill. Â That does not violate the (inane) Hastert Rule, so why are we discussing this like it&apos;s a problem?
