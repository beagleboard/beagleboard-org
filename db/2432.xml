The main talking point today is the roll-out of Help to Buy, the government&amp;#039;s mortgage scheme. Also, it&amp;#039;s the last day of the Royal Mail share sale and there is a new Â£50,000 coin in honour of Prince George&amp;#039;s christening.

I&apos;m not a fan of crossword puzzles &amp;ndash; these are probably manageable, but The New York Times-variety hurts my brain &amp;ndash; and I prefer my flashcards the old-fashioned way: on paper.

Isn&amp;#8217;t that the obvious question? The US government doesn&amp;#8217;t do something unless someone, or some key industry, is profiting (not to be confused with profiting in such a way as to create jobs in the US.

Surely our Presidents don&amp;#8217;t keep doing these deals without reason, even if that reason does hurt Americans (which is usually the case). Why do we continue letting ourselves get screwed?
