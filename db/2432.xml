Weiner used the nom de perv &quot;Carlos Danger&quot; as he sent lewd photos of himself to the woman and engaged in sex chats with her. Weiner, 48, fessed up after a gossip site called The Dirty posted allegations from an anonymous woman who said she had an online relationship with him for several months beginning in July 2012, when she was 22.
