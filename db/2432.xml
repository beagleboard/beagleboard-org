Their view of the world violates basic human rights. I really wish on a global stage with a global audience different groups would state their ideal society. As in women and minorities having their freedom restricted. If it was clearly out in the open, then people would rise up against this evil. Because that is what it is. Call it what you want, but wanting to control other peoples&amp;#8217; freedom is evil and wrong.
