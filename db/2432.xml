People can only guess how, less than stellar the S4 was, but I donât see many at all in the wild and the launch event itself couldnât have been more underwhelming. Samsung is fully aware heavy competition is coming to the commodity and mid-range Android market, from China, Taiwan and even the Google, assembled in the USA Android devices. Microsoft an Nokia want to play, while BlackBerry is hanging on to its dwindling, loyal customer base. They expect heavy price wars, because of limited differentiation between Android smartphones and low brand loyalty in both the commodity and mid-range market.

Apple is smart avoiding the commodity and mid-range smartphone market, it could be a bloodbath soon.
