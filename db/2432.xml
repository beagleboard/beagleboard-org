But while many a Hollywood starlet gets her boyfriend&apos;s name inked on them, at least Cyrus&apos; tat has a deeper meaning; it&apos;s a tribute to Vanessa, a 9-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis. The two apparently bonded after meeting at an L.A. hospital before Vanessa passed away in 2007. Miley also sports a heart, a small cross on her fingers and the word &apos;love&apos; on her ear.
