The bloodbath in Syria, which has claimed more than 90,000 lives, contradicts his narrative that the tide of war is receding in the Middle East. Moreover, the growing strength of al-Qaida&apos;s Syrian franchise refutes his claim that the war on terrorism has ended. The president also knows that direct U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war would be unpopular at home and politically risky.

A church full of innocent people was bombed, and all IdahoSteve can do is insult the faith and make a lame parallel to the treatment of gays. What if you were alive in the &apos;60s, Steve, when the innocent black girls were murdered by a KKK bombing? Would you say, &quot;why should the rest of us conform to those negroes.&quot; I am sure those 4% in Pakistan want nothing more than to go to church without muslims bombing them. Just like I want to believe in Jesus without a soulless person like you making asinine remarks about what you clearly do not understand. People are dead. Children.
