Instead he foisted a female-heavy âA-listâ of his preferred candidates onto the local Tory associations that pick them. They included successful businesswomen such as Margot Jamesâwho would become the first openly lesbian Tory MPâas well as careerists such as Priti Patel, who would become the first woman MP of Gujarati origin. Yet the success of the A-listers was fairly modest. About half were elected, swelling the number of Tory women MPs to 49, or 16% of the total. Even after this latest reshuffle, only five of the 32 politicians attending cabinet are womenâof whom only Ms May, the home secretary, is of the front rank. Again not coincidentally, many disgruntled Tory women MPs claim, Mr Cameronâs government is meanwhile considered to have done poorly on issues dear to women, including child care and child benefits. Opinion polls suggest many more female than male voters have deserted Mr Cameron since 2010.

He constructed the mold out of wood, then handmixed and poured the concrete. He created a bronze plaque with the words, âIn the Year of Our Lord 2012, Creer Pipi claimed this land for Azathoth.â
