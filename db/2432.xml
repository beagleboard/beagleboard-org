    <body>Could I borrow your phone, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/stmap_e52c0.html?himcolin-gel.pyridium-xl.trandate.cialis&quot;&gt;montelukast sodium drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  Perhaps it&apos;s the years of screaming, ranting, sweatingÂ lunacy he displaysÂ at Microsoft events (many of which you can watch for yourself on Youtube). Or the many employee stories of his tantrums. Or the fact that he was a salesman who found himself running a tech company because he happened to be Bill&apos;s buddy, even though he has no vision for the future of technology other than increasing sales. It might be the dozens of interviews he&apos;s done over the years where he&apos;s said idiotic things about the competition -- like the years he spent saying that iPhone was a joke that would never succeed (even after it was destroying Microsoft in the market) or that iPad was a fad that would never be used by business people.
