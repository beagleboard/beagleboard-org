A courageous young lady who has shown tremendous determination, pluck in spite of taunts and threats. She has recovered from the the gun-shots to her head and has advocated talks with her tormentors. Maturity of mind at such a tender age, she certainly deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.Prize.

Studies need to establish that it is the content of the media that triggers the increase in knowledge.&amp;rdquo; With no official government advice to guide them (one of the coalition Government&amp;rsquo;s first acts was to abolish Becta, the body for establishing technology in schools), schools have to make up the rules as they go along.
