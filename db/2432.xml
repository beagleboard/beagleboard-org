To prepare, you add your own fat replacer &amp;ndash; depending on the flavor, the packaging recommends mashed bananas, applesauce or pumpkin puree &amp;ndash; and up to 2 tablespoons of the sweetener of your own choosing. Use sugar, stevia, Splenda, agave nectar or my preference &amp;ndash; nothing at all. The result is a muffin with about 11 grams (!) of protein and a modest level of carbs and sugars customized to your tastes and dietary needs. The Banana Chocolate Chip and Pumpkin Spice were my faves. Yum!

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikasafloors.com/wwwhawthornehealthcom-bdec.pdf&quot;&gt;modahealth.com/pebb&lt;/a&gt;  These days, mini-bars are often left both warm and aggressively empty to circumvent thefts, but since I have no interest in any mini-bar&amp;#039;s contents I feel this bespeaks a hurtful lack of trust. And I wouldn&amp;#039;t - unlike some acquaintances - steal a towel, no matter how snowy, or unscrew a light fitting and take it home. But in a hotel corridor, if someone has happened to leave a room service trolley unattended and the biscuits in my room are horrible and there are all these packs of Bourbon creams just lying there and they are for guests and I am a guest and I would even bring the bloody fruit Shrewsburys that were in my room back (and I&amp;#039;d point out they&amp;#039;re not fruit Shrewsbury, they&amp;#039;ve got some currants, they&amp;#039;re mummified and sparse fruit corpse Shrewsburys) and I would possibly swap the Shrewsburys for the Bourbon creams which would be fair, but I know that, yes, my biscuit appropriation is still technically stealingâ¦ And I have helped myself to Bourbon creams, which is to say, stolen them. Once or twice.
