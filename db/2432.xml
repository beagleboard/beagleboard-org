As much as It pains me to say it, he was right. It&amp;rsquo;s how you respond to setbacks rather than the setback itself that defines you. For example, I missed out on racing at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 after contracting tonsillitis on the day of the Opening Ceremony. It was an utterly horrible experience. I&apos;d trained for four years only for it to be ripped away less than 24 hours before racing. But I genuinely believe without suffering that disappointment and putting everything I could in place to ensure it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen again I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have won gold in Sydney 2000. (Which reminds me of another phrase my coach (or Yoda) used to say &amp;ldquo;to jump high you have to bend low&amp;rdquo; i.e. you need to endure a setback to reach your full potential.)
