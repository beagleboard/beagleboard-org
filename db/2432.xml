Mubarak was sentenced last summer to life in prison for his failure to stop the killing of  hundreds of civilians during the 18-day revolution of 2011. After appealing the decision in January, Egypt&amp;#8217;s highest appeals court ordered a retrial.

Then, while he studied in London, another doctor took over the Australian captaincy in Percy McDonnell, who lost the next three Tests in a row &amp;ndash; and he could not heal himself either as he died aged 37.

The World Court has ruled that any country gaining land through military action may not remove the inhabitants and settle citizens of the victorious power on the conquered territories. This is ethnic cleansing whether the previous inhabitants are killed or not. The World Court can issue arrest warrants for Israeli officials who allow settlements in the West Bank, Gaza, or the Golan Heights, based on the borders prior to the 1967 war. Israel can be required to remove its citizens from Palestinian lands or face arrest warrants and/or international economic sanctions. Countries that willfully violate those sanctions, such as the US, can have sanctions imposed on them as well.

Â &amp;#8221;Haloarchaea are known for being &amp;#8216;promiscuous,&amp;#8217; that is, prone to exchange DNA between themselves. Our study demonstrated that this exchange occurs at a much higher level than has previously been documented in nature. They communicate, share, specialize, and coexist.&amp;#8221;
