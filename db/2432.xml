He does look to have something, a burst of acceleration and some natural talent. Bolivia captain Ronald Raldes spoke wisely after the game, pointing out that his compatriots &quot;need to support him, to help him grow in football and in physical terms, because he&amp;#039;s taken a giant stride and now he needs to sustain it&quot;. He is very slightly built, and I can&amp;#039;t see him in Europe for the next few years. Then again, staying in Bolivia for too long won&amp;#039;t do him a great deal of good. I think you might have nailed the solution with Mexico. No doubt about it, though - one to watch, and Bolivia badly need someone like him to come through.

The carvings have been confirmed to be the oldest recorded petroglyphs in North America - at least 10,500 years old. The findings were published August 2013 in the Journal of Archaeological Science. This site was once the shoreline of the now dried up Winnemucca Lake. (AP Photo/USGS, Larry Benson)
