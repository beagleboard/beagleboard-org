Trades are only possible with a claiming club after that, and a player who clears waivers becomes up for grabs for any trading partner. For example, if the Red Sox were interested a player but the Yankees didn&apos;t want Boston to get him and/or wanted him for themselves, the Yankees could put in a claim for that player and win it over the Red Sox because they&apos;re currently behind them in the standings. The player&apos;s current team can pull him back off waivers or work out a trade with whatever team put in the claim, or just let that team have the player.
