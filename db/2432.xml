The housing-industrial complex went to work. Into Dodd-Frank went a provision that certain &quot;safe&quot; mortgages, called qualified residential mortgages, or QRMs, would be exempt from the risk retention requirement. &quot;Safe&quot; was left to the regulators to define. Cue more lobbying. The rules finally proposed in late August would exempt, according to a Wall Street Journal piece by Alan Blinder, some 95 percent of mortgages from the risk retention requirement. In other words, the very asset that most people believed led to the credit crisis is also the asset that is pretty much exempt from the new rules! Classic. In the joint announcement on August 28, the regulators wrote, &quot;The Commission acknowledges that QM does not fully address the loan underwriting features that are most likely to result in a lower risk of default. However, the agencies have considered the entire regulatory environment, including regulatory consistency and the possible effects on the housing finance market.&quot; (That last bit is super scary.)
