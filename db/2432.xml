    <body>perfect design thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/feminil-en-peru-0bae.pdf#semi&quot;&gt;femenil en costa rica&lt;/a&gt;  Now turning to our capital allocation results and priorities during the quarter. As Gracia already touched on earlier, in conjunction with the announcement of our intent to acquire Belo, we announced that we would continue our existing annual dividend payment program. At the same time, we also announced that we would extend our share buyback program, replacing our existing remaining authorization with a new $300 million authorization expected to be carried out over the next 2 years. As you might surmise, we did not have the opportunity to repurchase a significant volume of shares during the second quarter due to the Belo transaction. As a result, we acquired just over 400,000 shares during the quarter for $8.6 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchase volume to 2.1 million shares, or $41.4 million. Beyond this, our dividend payout -- paid out approximately $46 million in the quarter, with fully $92 million paid out to shareholders to date.
