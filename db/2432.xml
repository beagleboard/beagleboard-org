Manuel is in the final year of his contract to manage Philadelphia and faces an uncertain future with the Phillies possibly finishing under .500 for the first time since 2002. &quot;I&apos;m going to be somewhere,&quot; he said. &quot;How about that? We&apos;ll see. It&apos;s OK. I&apos;ve got good options.&quot; ... Tigers LHP Darin Downs (left shoulder soreness) will make a rehab appearance Sunday for Triple-A Toledo. His return to Detroit after that isn&apos;t automatic. ... RHP Mike Adams, on Philadelphia&apos;s disabled list since June 21 with multiple right shoulder muscle tears, will have surgery on his shoulder next week that will put him out of action for at least the remainder of the season. He appeared in 28 games for Philadelphia this season, going 1-4 with a 3.96 ERA out of the bullpen.
