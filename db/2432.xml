    <body>I never went to university &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?entocort.cialis.sumatriptan&quot;&gt;metformin buy online canada&lt;/a&gt;  Of a million things President Obama could use his second term in office to fix, he has maybe 10 slots &amp;mdash; 10 real chances to advance the debate about a topic, even to advance policy, even while Washington is at its sclerotic worst. Drug law reform has always been on the president&apos;s to-do list. This I know from a series of conversations with some of his senior policy advisers during the first term. Because Obama&apos;s Justice Department has not stopped enforcing federal drug laws even as Americans are evolving quickly on the issue, and because Obama himself has not yet used one of those presidential attention-getting arrows he has, my prediction that he would move in his second term to attack the prison-drug-race nexus has been dismissed as wishful thinking, or, worse, something I just made up.
