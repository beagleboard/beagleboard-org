Rather, classrooms at every level are being transformed with the advent of new K-12 education standards, teaching requirements and technologies. April saw the release of the Next Generation Science Standards, based on revised frameworks from the National Research Council, which proponents say are a much-needed revamp of K-12 science education practices and expectations. Twenty-six states were on board for their development, and states will soon begin adopting and incorporating them into their schools. In late May, Rhode Island became the first state to adopt them, with Kentucky and Kansas following suit soon after.
