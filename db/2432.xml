Following the success of &quot;Jerry Maguire,&quot; Lipnicki went on to star in two &quot;Stuart Little&quot; films and &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; before deciding to step away from the lime light and lead a normal teenage life.

The loss closed out a miserable 2-6 road trip for the Yankees, who are 6-12 since the All-Star break, a stretch in which they played 15 of 18 games on the road.
