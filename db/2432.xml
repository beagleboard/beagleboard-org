In 1963, Justice Arthur Goldberg and his law clerk, Alan Dershowitz, advanced an argument, for basically the first time it had ever been made, that the Constitution was an evolving document and that the death penalty was a cruel and unusual punishment. Until the early 1960s, with one exception, nobody had argued that the death penalty was unconstitutional. It was not debated. Thereafter, a band of lawyers at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund began a litigation campaign to end executions in the United States.
