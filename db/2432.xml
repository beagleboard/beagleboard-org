    <body>In a meeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/elearningpharmacistcommy-training-e3c4.pdf&quot;&gt;elearning.pharmacist.com/ctp&lt;/a&gt;  1. Don&apos;t trust a government that doesn&apos;t trust you. As a country of the people for the people, I feel that the people should have the right to defend it&apos;s self against any abusive power that may come to be. That would include the right to RPG&apos;s or tanks or nuclear weapons if necessary. If our government has them then the people should have them too. The fact that you trust our government is foolish at best. No government is benign. My ancestors knew this, that why they wrote the right to bear arms in the constitution.
