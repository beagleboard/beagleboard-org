Nothing has eroded public support more for what was once a supposedly morally pure, Islamist government lead by the Sudanese chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood than the pervasive, systemic corruption of Bashir and his ruling party. A cable by the U.S. embassy in Khartoum made public by Wikileaks several years ago reported to Washington that as much as $9 billion had been systematically looted and sent abroad by the Bashir government. If anything, the looting of the national treasury has accelerated since then.
