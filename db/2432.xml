Once the argument is won&amp;#8212;gay marriage is a fine recent example&amp;#8212;the action will go with it, sometimes far more quickly than one expects. The broken consensus is vulnerable to simple aging, at the very least. There are no more grounds for despair about gun control than there were grounds for despair about the persistence of lynching in the face of the fight against that horror. The truth is known, obvious and inarguable. It cannot be said too clearly, and it cannot be said too often: guns make gun violence happen, gun-control laws make it stop. Anyone who says that this is &amp;#8220;dubious&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;uncertain&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;as yet undecided&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;up for argument&amp;#8221; is a liar or a fool or&amp;#8212;well, the third possibility is that he is a true &amp;#8220;American exceptionalist&amp;#8221;; that is, someone who believes that Americans are so intrinsically, genetically homicidal that the same gun laws that have alleviated violence and ended massacres in Canada and Australia and Great Britain and Europe won&amp;#8217;t work here. The only way not to know that is to decide not to know anything. People can do that for a long time, but not forever.

Itâs not a game for which you run out and buy a new console. In fact, it may reach a larger audience on the PS3.
