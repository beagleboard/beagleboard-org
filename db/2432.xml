    <body>Sorry, I&apos;m busy at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/kiwihealthjobscom-9392.pdf#sophia&quot;&gt;www.atulm.onlinepharma.biz&lt;/a&gt;  Researchers asked 63 heterosexual couples -- about half of whom lived together, and half of whom were in long-distance relationships -- to record their communications each day. The couples were an average age of 21, and those who were geographically apart had been together for an average of about 17 months. They were asked to write down how the communication took place (e.g. face-to-face, phone calls, video chat, texting, instant messenger and email), in addition to how much they shared about themselves, how intimate they felt, and the extent to which they thought their partner did the same.
