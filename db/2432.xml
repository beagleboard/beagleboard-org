Despite his profuse apology and the Eagles fining him and putting him on a leave of absence Friday to attend counseling sessions, can the African-American players on the Eagles and around the league forgive him? Will they make him a target on the field? Cooper became a more important player for the Eagles when Jeremy Maclin tore his ACL early in training camp, but the Eagles would be better off cutting him rather than dealing with a volatile issue that no team needs, It could follow them all season. Cooper stood in front of his teammates and apologized and many seem to be forgiving. Michael Vick tweeted, &quot;Riley&apos;s my friend. Our relationship is mutual respect. He looked me in the eyes and apologized. I believe in forgiveness and I believe in him.&quot; Linebacker DeMeco Ryans said, &quot;I don&apos;t think it will fracture the team,&quot; although wide receiver Jason Avant said it could take time to heal. &quot;It&apos;s not some kind of sweep-under-the-rug thing. We are family. Everything is tight-knit. There are certain things that we deal amongst our team.

He has just 46 catches in three years with the Eagles, production that is easily replaceable.
