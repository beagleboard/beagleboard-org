They found magnesium, iron, silicon and other heavy elements, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist naturally on the surface of a white dwarf, suggesting that they fell onto the star from an orbiting object. The researchers also found a huge excess of oxygen&amp;mdash;an amount, they say, that indicates the asteroid polluting the star&amp;rsquo;s surface was originally composed of 26 percent water. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty wet&amp;mdash;Earth, by contrast, is only 0.02 percent water. &amp;ldquo;This work marks the first detection of water-rich rocks in exoasteroids, and is an important step in developing a comprehensive picture of exoplanetary systems,&amp;rdquo; says Kevin France of the University of Colorado at Boulder, who wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved in the research.
