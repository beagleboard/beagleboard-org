He tells ABC News the organization came into being in 2005, in part as a response to a changing political and demographic landscape: For four decades prior to that, he says, the vast majority of Congressmen and Senators were fraternity/sorority members. Today, by his count, only 145 members of the House and Senate are (only 27 percent). &quot;We thought it important that government have more Greeks,&quot; he explains.
