    <body>I work with computers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/axon-medical-technologies-corp-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;axon medical center&lt;/a&gt;  It&amp;#039;s always weird when people ask me about it as a collaboration because it genuinely started out as a few guys in a studio having a laugh until people started building it up. We were just mates making music. In terms of it being a platform for me, it was incredible for what I do now and a great introduction to the music industry. I learnt a lot about my live show, about myself and about touring.
