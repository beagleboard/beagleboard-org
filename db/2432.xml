It comes hours after Bartolo Colon &amp;#x96; who wasn&apos;t alive then but cut it pretty close &amp;#x96; continued his own personal turn-back-the-clock season Friday night, beating his former team for the second time in five days in the A&apos;s 6-4 win at O.co Coliseum.

He shows that animals, like humans, can eat too much, not necessarily out of hunger, but also a result of &amp;ldquo;disinhibition&amp;rdquo; - whereby overeating is in response to stimuli other than internal hunger cues, such as stress. He also cites earlier studies to show that some animals offered an abundance of food do not overeat, as well as others showing a link between stress and negative emotions and eating.
