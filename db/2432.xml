But the chosen spot is empty. The piece won&amp;#x92;t arrive, Florida-based sculptor Sandra Priest said. Her work is at an &amp;#x93;undisclosed location&amp;#x94; in Utah, she said, because Evans, the co-founder and CEO of the American Fallen Warrior Memorial Foundation, broke her contract for the $225,000 sculpture, titled &amp;#x93;Star 11.&amp;#x94;

Opponents of a US strike have questioned whether the US will really suffer a blow to our reputation if we fail to act. They could not be more off base. Nation states, like individuals, are judged every day on whether they are reliable and honor their promises. Credibility is a real and tangible commodity in international politics.
