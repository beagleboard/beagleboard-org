Those six losses in seven games against the Red Sox over a 10-day period, two of which came in games Nova started, are likely to be remembered as the cause of death for their playoff hopes.

Infrared and radio waves both pierce that dust, but their long wavelengths require correspondingly large telescopes to achieve high resolution. That places fundamental limits on how closely the light emissions can be pinpointed relative to the black hole. After all, astronomers are trying to study a region smaller than the Solar System at a distance of 26,000 light years.
