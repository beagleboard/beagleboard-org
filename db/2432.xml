    <body>We used to work together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/tergus-pharma-nc-a6a4.pdf#dump&quot;&gt;tergus pharma linkedin&lt;/a&gt;  For those who&amp;rsquo;d been aboard, jetBlue&amp;rsquo;s seat-back TV screens helped induce panic, beaming in reckless live coverage from the networks. What the passengers needed was a calm and accurate explanation of exactly what was going on, and what was likely to happen at touchdown. What they got was sensational commentary from people who had no idea what they were talking about. The whole thing set up a weird and distasteful voyeuristic triangle: the terrified and transfixed passengers assumed they were watching themselves, where in truth they were watching us watch them. And all along there were better things on TV.
