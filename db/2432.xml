Unravel one and there&apos;s another and another. Obama&apos;s pinprick warning was made necessary by the knot-tightener in chief, Secretary of State John Kerry. He told a London press conference on Sept. 9 that a punitive strike on Syria for the &quot;obscenity&quot; (his word from an earlier statement) of gassing 1,400 of its own people &amp;ndash; including hundreds of children who died foaming at the mouth &amp;ndash; would be &quot;unbelievably small.&quot; This sounded like a parody of President Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s adoption of the African proverb, talk softly but carry a big stick. What this administration has done is the reverse: Talk loudly, but carry a small stick. And when challenged, drop the small stick in favor of small talk. And that&apos;s how we now end up with another president in the catbird seat, namely Russia&apos;s. Vladimir Putin seized on Kerry&apos;s off-the-cuff hypothetical remark that Syrian President Bashar Assad could avoid a missile strike by the U.S. if he turned over his complete arsenal of chemical weapons within the week.

The list is long: (1) a secure Suez Canal, (2) friendly relations with the U.S., (3) continued alliance with the pro-American Gulf Arabs and Jordanians, (4) retention of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, (5) cooperation with the U.S. on terrorism, which in part involves (6) isolating Brotherhood-run Gaza.

The proposal came a day after the rivals moved toward reopening a jointly run factory park closed since April.
