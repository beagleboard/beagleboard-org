    <body>I&apos;d like to apply for this job &lt;a href=&quot;http://teerandaz.com/stmap_131c0.html?norvasc.cialis.monoket.differin&quot;&gt;can i buy viagra over the counter in dubai&lt;/a&gt;  Where contemporary print journalism has fallen down on the job and contributed to its own decline is in its failure to cover evenly both sides of almost any story. This has not been lost on readers who, it is important to note, are consumers. They have choices to make and, in the age of the Internet, have been exercising them. This is why there are so many prominent liberals who believe that journalistic institutions, which they define as a &quot;public trust,&quot; should be operated as not-for-profit charities so that the essential connection between financial necessity &amp;ndash; the need to show a profit to remain in business &amp;ndash; and liberal bias can be, from their point of view, harmlessly severed.
