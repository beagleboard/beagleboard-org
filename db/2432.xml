Gifted with all the filmâs best one-liners (âYou hit like a vegetarianâ being the standout) and finally allowed to speak his native German onscreen, the former governor is all wild eyes and mischievous grins. His Rottmayer quickly becomes Breslinâs accomplice, and the two sketch out an impossible-yet-not-totally-absurd plot under the watchful eye of sadistic prison warden/amateur lepidopterist Hobbes (an icy Jim Caviezel).

So far in 2013, there have been SIXTEEN mass assassinations. It sure seems like there are a lot of folks out there developing a real-life hankering for the thrill of killing at will.
