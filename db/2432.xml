The many whitewashed stone crosses along the coastline are memorials to the drowned. One of the worst tragedies occurred in 1595, when 25 ships of the Spanish Armada were hit by a storm and 1,705 sailors died. In the past five centuries more than 500 ships have capsized and thousands of seamen drowned. Many of these were percebeiros. On average, five fishermen die every year. Recently a 28-year-old died when a wave threw him so violently on to a rock that he was knocked unconscious and drowned.
