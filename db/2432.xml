 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/ciprofloxacino-injetvel-preo-bd82.pdf#sick&quot;&gt;does ciprofloxacin treat uti&lt;/a&gt;  I had a very similar problem with CitiBusiness&amp;#8217;s AAdvantage Mastercard. Even though my company is on an autopay cycle and CitiBusiness recognized that, they ingeniously found a way to tack on interest charges each month. I only caught it when doing Quickbooks, spent a great deal of time calling them to get rectification.  They would not provide a logical explanation for why I was getting charged interest (fraud perhaps?) but did reverse the charges.  The moral?  You really have to watch these companies or as suggested above, vote with your feet.  I no longer use the card unless I have no choice.  When I told the supervisor of my intent to decrease use of their card, they did not seem to care.  They won&amp;#8217;t get it until large numbers of consumers take our business elsewhere.
