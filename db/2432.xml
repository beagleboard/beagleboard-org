After just three months of engagement bliss and then 72 days of marriage, the couple has split. The buxom brunette is filing for divorce from her NBA player husband. &apos;I hope everyone understands this was not an easy decision,&apos; Kardashian, 30, said in a statement to E!, which airs her numerous reality shows. &apos;I had hoped this marriage was forever, but sometimes things don&apos;t work out as planned. We remain friends and wish each other the best.&apos;
