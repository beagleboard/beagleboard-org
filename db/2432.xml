Both of these should be changed to match the intuition of our assumptions. Another example is their proposal that the number of work visas be based on market demand. Bush and Bolick accompany this observation with the illuminating insight that the need for work-based visas should be adjustable apart from congressional action. Under their proposal, Congress would always be able to tweak the formula for determining eligibility, but demand would be freed from the restraint of the inevitable lack of legislative action.
