    <body>I&apos;d like to apply for this job &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/kroger-pharmacy-tigertown-bd82.pdf&quot;&gt;kroger pharmacy airport road hot springs ar&lt;/a&gt;  Everyone read this post above. The customer service is incredibly hard to deal with. They recently changed their apn settings and didn&apos;t notify any of their customers. My wife was stuck without data, and we couldn&apos;t tell why. They gave us a scripted response that she was streaming Pandora too much and they capped her data. They were completely wrong. She had no data rather than slow data, and they didn&apos;t even bother to check her data for the month. It took weeks to get the new apn settings (and the ones listed on the website were incorrect). If you are in a financial position where you can pay more than the $45/mo. Get someone else.
