    <body>Thanks funny site &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/dave-ruel-anabolic-cooking-login-6a83.pdf#frozen&quot;&gt;anabolic cooking recipes bodybuilders&lt;/a&gt;  The one to which attaches the most extraordinary story is a species called the black robin (Petroica traversi). It occurs exclusively on the Chatham Islands, a small archipelago 528 miles east of mainland New Zealand. The bird had once been common and widespread across this entire island group but it underwent a rapid and devastating decline. It was very probably the arrival of sheep (about 60,000 by 1901), ogether with cats, dogs, rats, as well as Western agricultural practice and the wholesale use of fire to clear the islands&amp;rsquo; forests that caused the black robin to vanish completely from the archipelago&amp;rsquo;s main islands. By the late-19th century the species was confined to just 12.4 acres of scrub forest on the tiny islet of Little Mangere.
