    <body>We&apos;re at university together &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/longscom-photo-f2c2.pdf#approve&quot;&gt;longs.com&lt;/a&gt;  But, of course, that specialty society also has the most to gain by inflating that value. For one, it&amp;#8217;s in that society&amp;#8217;s direct interest to get its members paid as much as possible. For another, the most affected specialty society often receives a good chunk of its funding from pharmaceutical and medical device companies&amp;#8212;companies that also have a direct stake in the RUC&amp;#8217;s proceedings. When the RUC offers up generous reimbursement rates for a specific procedure, doctors generally do it more often, and that means they use more of certain drugs and devices, too. It&amp;#8217;s a positive feedback loop&amp;#8212;and everyone knows it.
