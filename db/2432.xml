    <body>Which team do you support? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jalapaoecolodge.com.br/index.php/stmap_7abb0.html?dimenhydrinate.benadryl.cialis&quot;&gt;order paxil&lt;/a&gt;  In an ideal world you would leave this job but I understand that at the moment wage packets aren&amp;rsquo;t that easy to come by, so it is probably best to stick it out for a while. It won&amp;rsquo;t be pleasant, but since this happened so quickly hopefully getting over it might be equally speedy. Your boss certainly seems to have moved on without too much dawdling. Take a leaf out of his book and start going on dates. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t particularly matter with whom, you just need something or someone to distract you from this Mr-and-Mrs fantasy.
