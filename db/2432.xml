    <body>I want to make a withdrawal &lt;a href=&quot;https://paradiseinmexico.com.mx/military-medical-personnel-agency-c13c.pdf&quot;&gt;military medical personnel fax number&lt;/a&gt;  Granville Bantock fits the image perfectly. His jovial bearded figure dominated the Victorian British musical scene, but despite the strenuous efforts of a few enthusiasts his music hasn&amp;rsquo;t survived, and this year&amp;rsquo;s Proms season offers a welcome chance to be reacquainted with it. Choosing the five pieces must have been hard, as Bantock did nothing by halves. He composed over 800 works, and even the most ardent Bantockian knows only a handful of them. Excess was the keynote of his character. His interest in the Orient, spurred by a training for the Indian Civil Service (his father didn&amp;rsquo;t approve of his musical interests, and wanted him to get a proper job) amounted almost to mania. His daughter Myrrha recalls &amp;ldquo;Chinese porcelain dogs, bronze dragons, Russian ikons, Javanese brass jars and all kinds of other Eastern ornaments were continually appearing, for G.B was never able to resist the temptation to spend money on such things. There was about him a kind of lavish oriental extravagance which made the hoarding of money completely foreign to his nature. Beautiful things were there to be enjoyed, and he surrounded himself with them until our house was a veritable storehouse of Eastern treasures.&amp;rdquo; A photograph survives of &amp;ldquo;G.B&amp;rdquo; dressed up as a Chinese conjuror for one of the family&amp;rsquo;s annual Christmas pantos.
