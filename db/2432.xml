    <body>I can&apos;t get a signal &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/tauro-test-v2-reviews-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;anabolic designs tauro test side effects&lt;/a&gt;  Human folly or human wisdom or human technological ability are also part of the evolution of this planet and they must also have a reason to exist as much as the mosquito in general or the as much as the eradication of Aedes aegypti by Aedes albopticus, mentioned in the article. I am no expert in mosquito biology, but if indeed there are only a few species of mosquito that feed on blood and transmit diseases, maybe the way to go would be to invent ways to eradicate these species only. Certainly, if the article is at all valid, the eradication of a percentage of the mosquito population on this planet would have negligible environmental effect and immense benefit to the life standard in many places of the world. Or it might even be possible to change the blood drinking mosquitoes genetically so that they could not transmit disease, thus eradicating the spread of the disease rather than the carrier of it. Of course, the spread of the disease must have an evolutionary point as well, which I can only see as selective pressure on mammals for better health or killing some of them in order to keep ecosystems balanced. However, I do not think that evolution is a super god that does everything right. And even if it is so, maybe the wisest thing evolution has created is the human curiosity, the Hercules who destroyed the Stymphalides birds with the metal beaks, the Prometheus that stole the fire from cruel gods. Maybe human intervention including eradication of unnecessary evil, ugliness and death and the promotion of the weak and all they have to offer next to the strong and their naturally selected super health, is something the planet wants and that is why we are still here.

Interstellar clouds like these are stellar nurseries, where baby stars are being born. (UCLA / JPL-Caltech / NASA)
