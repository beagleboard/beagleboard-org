    <body>We&apos;d like to offer you the job &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/themedicineboxcouk-83f5.pdf#released&quot;&gt;themedicinebox.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;  We&apos;ve only got four races left for the pair to lock horns for the final time, so let&apos;s hope it happens somewhere. Undoubtedly Webber lost his chance to win the race when he was stuck behind Grosjean for four or five laps. Traditionally harder on his tyres than his team-mate, having to do that extra stop in the end proved just a tad slower. The haters out there will say this was Red Bull favouring the German over the Australian, but by my reckoning it was a fairly simple case of one being gentler on these Pirelli tyres than the other.

New recruits were not permitted to address senior members, on pain of beating. She herself was once made to do 30 push-ups and kicked in the ribs after protesting about jokes she said she found racist.

Indeed, what an incredible act of bravery of Mr. Idriss to show himself in a province (do you even know where exactly he was?) where radicals recently have killed and driven out many civilians (as the author points out) simply because of the sect they belong to. Well done Reuters for giving this hero the platform he deserves.
