By now, almost all baseball and sports fans have intimate knowledge, or at the very least have heard in passing, the term &quot;Biogensis&quot;. Biogenesis of course was the name of the company started and headed by Anthony Bosch. Bosch and his company allegedly, sold some sort of PED to numerous athletes including baseball players, stars and regulars alike. Last we left the story of the Biogenisis investigation, MLB had filed a lawsuit against Bosch in the hopes of procuring important documents in the discovery phase that might not lead to criminal or civil prosecution, but could have aided in the league&apos;s investigation into whether specific MLB and MiLB players procured and took PEDs from Bosch.

Until the layoffs are 0 and the US starts adding 150,000 or more jobs this is not good news. Unemployment is going down because people are running out of unemployment and the states no longer count them. Most of these people will not work again. Homeless is up, people living on the street is up, people living with their parents or kids or friends is up. How is this good.
