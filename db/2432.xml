    <body>Could you transfer $1000 from my current account to my deposit account? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/can-you-take-ibuprofen-600-mg-with-tramadol-e0f9.pdf#really&quot;&gt;how many ibuprofen 600 mg can i take to get high&lt;/a&gt;  âI had no idea my photo was even being taken but Iâm glad&amp;#8230; maybe my parents or someone who knows them will see me and recognize me. Maybe they will help me find them.â Those words left a lump in my throat. Though I often photograph arriving would-be immigrants, it&amp;#8217;s very rare that I&amp;#8217;m able to speak to them afterwards, and gauge their reaction to being photographed. Hearing what Mohammed had to say gave shooting these pictures a stronger sense of purpose than ever before, however remote the odds of his finding his parents through the photo may be.
