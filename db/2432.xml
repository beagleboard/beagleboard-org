    <body>I have my own business &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/how-to-make-permethrin-cream-5-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;where can i buy permethrin for scabies&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8220;Please pay by&amp;#8221; is for those who pay their monthly balance every month. You only get &amp;#8220;Payment due&amp;#8221; dates if you are a good customer that have a balance and let them suck fees and interest out of you. If they get you tagged as a &amp;#8220;last day payer&amp;#8221; then they send the bill just just a few days before its due. If you sign up for autopay, then they will charge your account 2 weeks before the due data if you sign up to pay the balance and on the due date if you carry a balance. These are all policies keept secret (like your due dates) and they do it because it is legal and profitable (not included in required disclosures).
