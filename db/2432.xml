They (the &apos;baggers) have chosen to take budget negotiations and turn them into their own pathetic ideological crusade against the Affordable Care Act. And they will lose. In time, the American people will all see that. The utter hatred and contempt the &apos;baggers have displayed toward this President is unprecendented and quite frankly, disgusting!! And the sad part is, these pathetic souls don&apos;t care. It is their fault, simply put. The ACA is the law of the land and cannot be defunded. What really scares these morons is not whether the ACA will fail, rather, they know it will succeed in its purpose and become popular. And when that happens, you won&apos;t hear even one them refer to it as Obamacare any more!
