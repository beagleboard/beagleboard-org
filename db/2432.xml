At just 2.3 mm long, it may be the smallest dung beetle in the Guiana Shield, and perhaps the second smallest of currently described species in South America. Itsâ antler-like antennae provide an acute sense of smell. Dung beetles play critical ecological roles that help support healthy ecosystems â by burying dung, they regulate parasites and disease, disperse seeds, and recycle nutrients to promote plant growth. Since dung beetle communities are tightly linked with the mammals which provide them with food, they are also commonly studied as indicators of hunting intensity and ecosystem health.
