    <body>What&apos;s the last date I can post this to  to arrive in time for Christmas? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/stmap_0bae0.html?viagra.rulide.eldepryl.coreg&quot;&gt;humana price of drugs&lt;/a&gt;  My representative voted exactly the way that the majority of people in our district wished the vote to go. This Texas woman wishes that Wendy Davis would never have made the claim that she speaks for Texas women. Frankly, she doesn&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;ve been pregnant three times, have three wonderful children to show for it. I can honestly attest to the fact that my children were alive inside me, and only used my womb for 9 months each. As a nurse who has provided care to premature infants, some of them at 22 weeks gestation, I have watched these tiny infants respond to pain. I&amp;#8217;m sure that&amp;#8217;s not something miraculous that happened once they were moved from inside the uterus to outside the uterus, they already had the pain synapses completed before birth. Texans are making a step forward to show that we are a group of people who care, and I am proud to be a Texas woman who speaks out for life.
