The two-second window is entirely justifiable on legal grounds &amp;#8212; but when you start talking about algobots paying large sums to get a eye-blink head start on market-moving information, potentially making millions of dollars while doing so, then an aggressive New York AG has all he needs to start making lots of hay. It&amp;#8217;s probably best to sacrifice the two-second window, at least temporarily, lest Schneiderman start drawing a bead on the five-minute window, next. No one wants him to start getting ideas about the multi-billion-dollar market in financial information more broadly.

If you did, you would be telling your elected representatives to NOT cut funding for VA hospitals, to NOT cut funding for SNAP, to NOT cut funding for Tricare, to NOT table legislation that would help military veterans find civilian jobs. But you all don&apos;t freaking CARE about any actual people beyond yourselves. As long as you&apos;ve got yours, who gives a flying F at a doughnut what other people may be going through?

Kraig Gray wrote FoxNews.com in an email late Thursday. âThere are a few pieces of the investigation that have yet to be concluded that may or may not be helpful. We hope to wrap it up â¦ soon. Bottom line, we are still investigating.â
