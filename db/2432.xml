Meanwhile, insurgents killed six people in the capital of Iraqâs autonomous Kurdish region yesterday. Prime Minister Nuri al Malikiâs spokesman said the deadly attack may be linked to the bloody civil war in Syria. A statement from the Kurdish asayesh security service said a bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to their headquarters in Arbil, the capital of the northern region. Asayesh forces then clashed with four more bombers, killing them, before another detonated an explosives-rigged ambulance. Kurdistan region health minister Raykot Hama Rashid told journalists that six asayesh members were killed and more than 60 people wounded in the attack. â Agencies
