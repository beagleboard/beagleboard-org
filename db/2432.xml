When Peyton, then a free agent, needed a facility to rehabilitate from his fourth neck surgery during the 2011 lockout, Cutcliffe welcomed his mentee into his house and shuttled him to and from campus in a black Cadillac Escalade with tinted windows. Eli came the previous spring, retooling his approach before embarking on his second Super Bowl MVP campaign. In April, Peyton, in his second year with Denver, invited receivers Wes Welker, Eric Decker and Demaryius Thomas to join him. Eli brought Victor Cruz, Hakeem Nicks and Louis Murphy. Once done, Cutcliffe called over to Cameron Indoor Stadium. He inquired about availability on the historic basketball court. Told the space was open, the group engaged in perhaps the gymâs highest-salaried game of knockout in its 73-year-old history.
