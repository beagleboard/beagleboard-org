    <body>One moment, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/northwesternpharmacycom-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;ukhotjocks.com&lt;/a&gt;  Zac Efron managed to combine work and charity recently while filming &apos;The Lucky One&apos; in New Orleans. The actor, who is portraying a Marine in the movie adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks book, had to lose his famous locks for the part, which called for a buzz cut in some scenes. The act inspired Efron to convince the film&apos;s crew to cut their hair, as well, all in the name of charitable sacrifice, the Times-Picayune reported.Efron, 23, pledged to donate money to Kingsley House, a New Orleans-based organization that serves local families, for every staffer that trimmed his or her head.
