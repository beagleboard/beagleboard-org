But for the first time in American history, wages were withheld from the workers who made such production and profits possible. Companies were then flush with cash. Ceo&amp;#8217;s made insane bonuses. Where did they get the cash? From the withheld wages. Companies then bought each other. so on and so forth. Now the companies are flush with cash but are killing the goose that made this all possible. So much for the general welfare. If the workers have no money to spend where will the funds come from to stimulate the economy. It looks like a sick joke to everyone involved, black, white, brown, yellow, and red. We have all been made a nation of slaves.

I showed him some pictures on my phone &amp;#8212; pictures of my family, my dog. He was very interested, so I began to tell him more about Beijing. I said that many people could not afford housing in Beijing because of the high property prices, and said that the economy was good in China but the air and water quality much worse. He spoke in a low voice, and finally, almost secretly, told me I was welcome to come back to his country again. âThe first time we are friends, the second time we will be best friends, and the third time we will be brothers.â As for Minder G, we apologized to each other during the last dinner, it was a good ending.
