    <body>I&apos;d like to transfer some money to this account &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/stmap_b1c80.html?chloromycetin.viagra.neggram.crixivan&quot;&gt;central mass construction&lt;/a&gt;  this country does not need the department of homeland security, that was just another knee jerk B.S. thing leftover from George W. Bush actually all these federal agencies need to be either consolidated or eliminated completely we do not need the CIA the FBI the ATF the DEA and the military too you want to talk about saving money, clean the dead weight out of the federal government, cut congresses pay to be commensurate with their abilities I am pretty sure most of our elected leaders would be in debt to the country if they were paid what they were worth these guys are making way too much money to be such morons, how about some accountability&amp;#8230;.some of us don&amp;#8217;t feel too warm and fuzzy about our elected idiots at this point&amp;#8230;..they should all be at the curb from the president down to the lowest mayors and sheriffs and elected police officials and city and town boards, they are all extremely corrupt and bought and paid for, DISGUSTING&amp;#8230;
