For instance, medical residents specializing in OB/Gyn will opt to finish their training in states other than TX, leaving all Texan women with fewer and less-skilled doctors. More women &amp; children will be added to the TX welfare rolls, despite the governor&amp;#8217;s best efforts to limit social aid to the needy. (Wealthy women will simply hop a plane or drive across state lines for an abortion, like they always have.) Professional working women, when faced with the choice between a job in TX and another state, will choose not to live in TX. The effects won&amp;#8217;t be immediate, but over time, these kinds of short-sighted moves will drag down the Texas economy in many arenas.
