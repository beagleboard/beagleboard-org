Young people today often seem to lack a sense of hope and doubt the ability of humanity to deal with the big problems we face. Apollo was a magic time for the youth of the 1960s. That magic help the US take the lead in STEM which has given America the technology we enjoy today. The best reason to send humans back to the moon is the hope that every country in the world that participates will see the same jump in their local STEM capabilities. Perhaps children will again be able to dream of being a rocket scientist or walking on Mars.
