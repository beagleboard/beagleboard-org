In the social group, the dog&apos;s owner and the experimenter first interacted with each other like regular humans while the dog looked on.

PeopleBotÂ² went through the same sort of motions with the human experimenter just executed by using sociable behaviors on its customized &quot;social&quot; setting with the dog owner. After that, the dog was brought in to interact with the robot in the reverse order of the tasks performed.
