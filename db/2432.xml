    <body>Could you ask him to call me? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdesighn.com/best-drugstore-mascara-for-dramatic-lashes-2013-b26f.pdf&quot;&gt;generic vs brand name over the counter drugs&lt;/a&gt;  Investors have come to expect strong performances from the Booker cash and carry group. It did not disappoint. Third quarter sales rose 3.1 per cent, pushing the shares ahead to around 100p. I believe they would be higher but for the uncertainty created by the Competition Commission&apos;s examination of the group&apos;s Â£140m take-over of the rival Makro chain. The Commission is unlikely to report for a few months. Charles Wilson, Booker&apos;s chief executive, seems optimistic the deal will eventually be cleared. He declares: &quot;We are excited about the opportunity of Booker and Makro coming together&quot;. Makro has found the going tough in recent years and the Wilson team clearly have high hopes of quickly reviving it.
