This is the first time âNew Yorkâs Hometown Airlineâ has separated the cabin into first (which JetBlue calls âMintâ) and coach (which JetBlue calls âcoreâ) class. On the new Airbus A321 planes, which are scheduled to start flying in June, 16 Mint passengers at the front of the plane will have seats that recline into full horizontal. Four of those passengers will even be a âprivate suite,â with a door that slides closed to block off from the aisle.
