    <body>I read a lot &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/docosanol-kaufen-bd82.pdf#frantically&quot;&gt;purchase docosanol&lt;/a&gt;  Syria has been a client state of Iran since 1979, and Iran has been a major supplier of arms to the Assad government during the civil war. Iran has used Iraq, its newest client state, as a corridor to supply those arms. King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the firmest U.S. allies in the region, in a television interview in the U.S. last year described the fear of encirclement by Iranian client states in Syria, Iraq and Shia-dominated Southern Lebanon. Jordan and Lebanon, given their size, are destabilizing because of proportionately large refugee flows from the Syrian civil war into their densely populated countries.
