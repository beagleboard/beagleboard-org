Both River Court and Chapelfield are strong loans capable of repaying in full. Cannonbridge has suffered several years of underperformance, but is now riding a wider recovery in central London rents. With loan maturity in 2015 and a fully income-producing rent roll (including some index-linkage), there is hope that the Cannonbridge A-note will avoid a loss. However, because the Cannonbridge B-note is capitalising unpaid interest, Fitch expects the whole loan to default at maturity in January 2015, which should switch note principal payment to a fully sequential basis in time for repayment of the other loans.
