Mothers who spanked their child at least twice a week when they were 3 also had children more likely to have these problem behaviors.

Give the man his due: Rodman was a terrific rebounder and played for championship teams with some great players. He will continue his successful career with Jung Un playing at center, easily able to intimidate American imperialist stooge centers such as Shaq, Howard, etc. His team of 5&apos;3&quot; North Koreans will show the world that North Korea is not to be trifled with. Way to go, Dennis. We are so proud of you!!!

Dave Brennan is running full-day, everyday, porgy trips on his Peconic Star Express. Heâs been scouting for them out that way at depths varying from 15 to 60 feet, depending on tides and weather. Thatâs all within an easy hour from the dock. His Peconic Star II, on the other hand, is switching to porgy charters on weekends, with space available now. Get your names in soon, though, since most Fridays are already spoken for.
