    <body>I&apos;d like to send this parcel to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucky-websolutions.com/healthsquareorg-0a7b.pdf#specialist&quot;&gt;uottawameds.com&lt;/a&gt;  The Israelis and Palestinians should find way to peace than conflict. This can only be done by making religion a choice of the individual than a state sponsored policy. The Palestinians should wake up from their dream and understand and accept the fact that Israelis are humans and they have every right to be where they are. The Israelis should understand and accept that the Old temple is gone and to building a new one where a grand mosque is standing is practically impossible. Why not make a temple right beside the Mosque? Is it really necessary for people to be in a specific spot on Earth for God to hear us? I donât think so. The Islamic community should take the initiative in building a Jewish Temple right beside the Al-Aqsa mosque. A true Muslim cannot say that a Jewish temple cannot be built or Jews cannot come into the mosque. If a Muslim says it he is not following the Quran if a person is not following the Quran that person is not a Muslim. So in a nutshellâ¦. Leave all emotional catastrophes behind and understand what matters most is everyone got the right to live in freedom.
