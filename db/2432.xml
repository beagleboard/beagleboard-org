Long-time video-game players are guilty of innumerable virtual crimes, from minor indiscretions like jaywalking, in Atari&amp;#8217;s Frogger, and smoking indoors, in Metal Gear Solid, to more serious outrages like driving under the influence, in Grand Theft Auto; gunning down an airport filled with civilians, in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II; and full-scale genocide in Sid Meier&amp;#8217;s Civilization series.
