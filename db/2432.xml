Several seconds later with his father, Angel looking on concerned, Garcia made the limit of 140 pounds on his second attempt.

The preseason game was a nice start, an 86-62 victory for the Nets built on a hearty defense that held the Heat to 32% shooting. Still, James has good reason to feel better than everyone else. He happens to be better. His disregard for the Nets over the years has bordered on arrogance, and at times has been downright provocative.
