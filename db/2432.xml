    <body>The manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/doctorsofficedenvercocom-b01a.pdf#even&quot;&gt;gnrpharma.com&lt;/a&gt;  â And can you tell us, who was the scout who recommended we take that high school shortstop, C.J. Henry, with our No. 17 pick in 2005? Is he still working for us? Do you have our scouting reports on Jacoby Ellsbury, whom the Red Sox took at 23, or Clay Buchholz, whom they took at 42? Or Jed Lowrie, whom they took at 45 â college guys, all of them, who should have had a much clearer track record, no? We rated Henry better than ALL of them?
