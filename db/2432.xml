Weeks testified that Bulger, who is being tried on a racketeering indictment that pins 19 murders on him, suspected that one of the men, Brian (Balloonhead) Halloran, was a government snitch.

While Japan was overtaken by China three years ago, the would-be club of future superpowers is having its own problems right now: a real estate and credit bubble in China; decelerating growth, corruption and drift in India; labor violence, commodity price collapse and capital flight in South Africa; political unrest and central government bloat in Brazil; and a slow-but-steady sinking toward kleptocratic, oil-dependent autarky in Russia.

He was hired immediately as a freelance engineer and blended in seamlessly, often winning the companyâs weekly âGetting [expletive] Doneâ award, and hanging out after work with his new co-workers, particularly Glass. After work, they would go on bike rides around the city or to live music shows and drink late into the night, usually talking about technology. Dorsey and Glass soon became inseparable.

Worldwide, we have to fully stop using these fossil fuels 2030, with a rapid phase out occurring immediately. Only if the United States leads this effort do we have a chance.
