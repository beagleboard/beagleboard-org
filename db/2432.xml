The couple, who divorced in 2011 after 13 years of marriage, exchanged vows in a lavish $1.8 million ceremony, according to Life &amp; Style . &quot;Both of us want this, so it will definitely work this time,&quot; the &quot;Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot; star told the magazine. &quot;I know exactly what I&apos;m getting myself into.&quot; The nuptials were attended by 400 guests, including Kim Zolciak, Fantasia Barrino, Vivica A.

Seems that pre 1996 benchmarks might be required.
