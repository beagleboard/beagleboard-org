The plan resulted in serious weight loss, which led appearance-conscious celebrities of yesteryear to come to Durham for the cure.

The shuttles will never fly again, but they have a different kind of value now. The things they did and the stories they tell can inspire and shame in equal measureâprodding us to make our way back into space and forcing us to explain ourselves if we don&amp;#8217;t. The same is true of the men who flew the early missions. Just last Saturday, the very same Stafford and Cernan, now 82 and 79, flew to Lake Forest, Ill., to attend a rousing 85th birthday celebration for Jim Lovell, the Gemini 9 back-up and the commander of the Apollo 13 mission Andrews missed. All of the men are still active, all of them still travel and work (Lovell only grudgingly agreed to give up flying his own plane last year) and all of them, having done their generation&amp;#8217;s bit to make America a space-faring nation, jolly well expect this generation to carry that effort on. That&amp;#8217;s a message Endeavour&amp;#8217;s victory lap ought to send too.
