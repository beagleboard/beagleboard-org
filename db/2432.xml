Ruskin, who revered Turner as an artist, disapproved of the way he &amp;ldquo;wallowed&amp;rdquo; there at weekends and destroyed some drawing apparently done there of &amp;ldquo;of sailors&amp;rsquo; women&amp;hellip; in every posture of abandonment&amp;rdquo;. It puzzled his contemporaries that Turner was so unlike the prevailing notion of a genius. The French master Delacroix thought he had &amp;ldquo;the look of an English farmer&amp;rdquo;.
