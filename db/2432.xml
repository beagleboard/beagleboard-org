    <body>I can&apos;t get through at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/recept-fri-viagra-ab8a.pdf&quot;&gt;pris viagra p resept&lt;/a&gt;  So there&apos;s a solution. We just won&apos;t play any more games without some serious givebacks. We&apos;re done. The league has become so dominated by the Patriots, against the mandate of millions of American fans who don&apos;t happen to live in or around suspiciously liberal Boston that it can only be saved if the Patriots are slapped back. Here&apos;s our offer: We&apos;ll play on Sundays (and the occasional Monday or Thursday night), as we have been contracted to do, but only if the Patriots give up the three Super Bowl rings they&apos;ve earned in the last 11 years. Yes, those games have been waged and the winners declared. But things are different now. We have a new coach. We have E.J. Manuel. We have Freddie Jackson, Aaron Williams and Kiki Alonso. They&apos;re all pretty new to the team and had nothing to do with the Patriots&apos; usurpation of the NFL championships. Why should the new blood on the team have to live with the losses of their predecessors?
