Iâve been advocating for STEM visas and start up visas for at least five years both publicly on my blog and privately meeting with lots of elected officials advocating for this. I always hear the same thing which is, we cannot do immigration reform piecemeal. We have to do it in a comprehensive way. The reason is stakeholders on both sides of the issue have so much investment in comprehensive reform that even though they would both agree that a STEM visa or a start up visa makes all the sense in the world they wonât do it because it will take the pressure off. Everybody in Silicon Valley will say, âWe got what we needed. We no longer care about immigration reform.â All that pressure to get comprehensive immigration reform&amp;#8230;they want to direct all the people who want piecemeal pieces of immigration reform to be vested in comprehensive immigration reform. Thatâs why whatâs going on is going on. But I think weâre going to get it this year because I think the politics have changed.
