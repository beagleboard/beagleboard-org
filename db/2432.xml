What they found was that people who experienced discrimination earlier were 2.5 times more likely to have become obese by the time of the follow-up assessment in 2010. Participants that were already obese and perceived discrimination in 2006 were more likely to remain obese than those who did not perceive discrimination. Discrimination based on gender or race did not appear to have the same correlation with weight. &amp;#8220;Weightism&amp;#8221; also appeared to be independent from age, ethnicity or education.

The Tunisian authorities arrested her in May after she wrote âFemenâ on a cemetery wall. Prosecutors announced a number of charges against her, including âdesecrating a cemeteryâ and âundermining public morals,â according to the human rights group Amnesty International.
