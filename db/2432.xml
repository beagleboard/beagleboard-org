So the new coach of the Brooklyn Nets will take his plea on Tuesday morning in Hampton Bays, then will appear back in court, probably in October, for what is still being called his sentencing. Burke says that if the DAâs office is satisfied with the good works that Kidd has done between now and then, Kiddâs plea will likely be vacated at that time.
