    <body>Your cash is being counted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/buy-winstrol-online-australia-f2c2.pdf#medieval&quot;&gt;yj generics winstrol&lt;/a&gt;  Wind facilities are getting a $22/MWh tax credit for every MWh they deliver. On a pre-tax basis, that&amp;#039;s worth almost $34/MWh, so they will offer down to -$34/MWh before they would consider turning off. Electricity is the only physical commodity that you can&amp;#039;t store, so market participants will take a lot of pain overnight to keep their units on in order to be available for the peak daytime market. Even if you can turn on and off efficiently, you run the risk that something can break during startup, which would mean you have to buy back your position in the peak realtime market, which inherently will have a higher clearing price since you&amp;#039;ve self-created a shortage.
