Of the athletes with CTE, three showed no symptoms at the time of death. On the other hand, a total of 22 had shown behavior and mood problems as their first symptoms, while 11 had cognitive issues â memory and thinking problems â as their first symptoms. Those with behavior and mood problems experienced their first symptoms at a much younger age â usually, at an average age of 35. Meanwhile, the average age for a first show of symptoms in the group displaying cognitive problems before other damage was 59.
