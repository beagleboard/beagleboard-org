Non-GAAP operating margin reached 33.9%. VMware continues to build momentum globally because weâre uniquely positioned to help our customers transform to the mobile cloud era of computing. With our portfolio of solutions that extend from the desktop to the data center to the cloud weâre enabling IT teams to liberate resources from the client server environments while building the mobile cloud infrastructure that will power their businesses into the future. Our strong performance in Q3 is clear validation that our customers have confidence in our ability to help them address the IT requirements of both today and tomorrow. Across the business weâre laser focused on delivering unique customer value in three strategic growth areas, software defined data center, hybrid cloud, and end-user computing. These three focus areas are powerful individually but also produce significant advantages for VMware by leveraging synergies across these three inter-related businesses.
