    <body>Free medical insurance &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/rx-media-pharma-mac-5522.pdf#corner&quot;&gt;age to buy prescription drugs&lt;/a&gt;  On the morning of July 20, a Sunday, Martoma supposedlyreached out to Cohen. &quot;It&apos;s important,&quot; he said, according tothe SEC, and the two supposedly spoke for nearly 20 minutes.

So it is disappointing, not only for myself as a friend but for obviously Wisconsin sports fans, Brewer fans, Major League Baseball fans. It doesn&apos;t feel great being lied to like that, and I&apos;m disappointed about the way it all went down.&quot;

And Jonathan thanks for the detail on the guidance. Thatâs really helpful. But I guess my question is probably for Pat or Carl, I mean, you have a lot going on at VMware and you went through a lot of it on the call, but vSphere, your core virtualization market product is still the majority of your business today. I realize itâs less so as time goes on, but if you had to characterize where you were in the x86 compute capacity that still need to be virtualized. Where might that be? I mean, there is a lot of talk that 70% to 75% of x86 workloads have been virtualized. And I think you come up with the numbers similar to that, but you donât get paid based on the number of workloads that gets virtualized, you get paid based on the number of CPUs that gets virtualized or the number of â the amount of compute capacity. And I guess even roughly where that might be relative to that 70% to 75%?
