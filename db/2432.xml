We have proposed myriad possible functions for these toeholds on the infinite: laboratory, Earth-observation post, astronomical observatory, technology test-bed, hotel, shipyard for assembling spaceships for voyages to the moon and beyond, assembly base for large space structures, propellant depot, communications relay, battle station, geopolitical prestige generator, quarantine facility for arriving samples from Mars, factory, and experiment in international cooperation.

He was first elected as a councillor back in 1980 and has gained a reputation as a hard worker and a tough talker. He recently told Birmingham taxpayers that they either pay more in their council tax bills or go without certain services. Prior to local politics he used to lecture at Aston University on nuclear reactor physics.
