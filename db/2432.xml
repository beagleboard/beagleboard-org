But it&apos;s clear by looking at his frame that he&apos;s in the best shape of his stock car career. Yes, he was tired of the flab, but not just because he was overweight, but because of what it represented.

Not create politically unacceptable rationing, such as making people wait for months to see a specialist, as Canada does. Whether you prefer the Canadian system to ours or not, suddenly subjecting seniors to months-long waits will result in the rapid demise of whatever system you have devised.
