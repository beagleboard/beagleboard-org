    <body>I can&apos;t get a signal &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/medical-specialties-distributors-new-mountain-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;medical specialties distributors&lt;/a&gt;  Rather than boycott the Olympics in Sochi or the World Cup in Qatar, it&amp;rsquo;s best to view global sporting events like these in the same light as the UN. As the chief architect of the UN, the U.S. could have set up the institution in any way it desired. Ultimately, it chose to create an inclusive organization where any state that wants to participate is allowed, and the overall rules are relatively fair. Washington did this because it realized it was better to have every state within the UN, through which it could bind them to various commitments, cooperate on select issues, spread liberal norms, monitor their behavior, and communicate when necessary. In other words, it is much better to have them inside the UN and the international system it represents, than on the outside looking in. In this way, the U.S. can interact with and influence rival or enemy states in ways that would otherwise be very difficult to achieve outside the structure of the UN.
