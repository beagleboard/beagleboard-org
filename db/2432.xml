He declined to say anything further about where Snowden may be, except that it&apos;s a &quot;safe place&quot; and that Snowden&apos;s spirits are high. Assange also said that Snowden can still travel, despite not having a U.S. passport, because Ecuador provided him with &quot;refugee&quot; travel documents.
