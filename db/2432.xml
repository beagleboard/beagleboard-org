    <body>I&apos;d like to open a personal account &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/flonase-coupon-card-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;flonase nasal spray uses&lt;/a&gt;  That&amp;#039;s actually a really idiotic idea. Honestly, I agree, violent video games can affect the minds of young people. But it should be noted that every M rated game requires the stamp of approval from a guardian to buy. If a parent is deliberately ignoring the fact that their child is easily influenced, or prone to violent behaviour, then the blame shouldn&amp;#039;t lie on the video games, it should lie on the parents. For most people, video games are a fun passtime where you get to do things you normally couldn&amp;#039;t. Denying all because of the initial irresponsibility of adults, not the kids, is unjust. And if you banned guns and enforced the ban then there wouldn&amp;#039;t really be much of a problem with gun violence would there? Also, just one more thing. The 250 dead so far you&amp;#039;re mentioning? Yeah, that&amp;#039;s the lowest death toll Chicago has had in 50 years. Explain to me again how video games are the cause of all murder in the world..
