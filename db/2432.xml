Life had stopped, like watching a film and suddenly it hangs on one frame. It was a new kind of death to me. [...] The aftermath was worse. Victims were still being brought in. Some villagers came to our chopper. They had 15 or 16 beautiful children, begging us to take them to hospital. So all the press sat there and we were each handed a child to carry. As we took off, fluid came out of my little girl&amp;#39;s mouth and she died in my arms.&quot;
