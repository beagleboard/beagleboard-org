Epsom is such a unique course, and it has so much history about it. Riding the full Derby course was great. Dad rode in the race in his time, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t win it. So, I&amp;rsquo;m one up on him there,&amp;rdquo; said Mullins.

Weeksâ lone invitation to an NFL camp was the Eagles stint. The twinsâ father, Buddy, was head coach then. Weeksâ biggest period on a Division I college staff came in 1998 when Rex was defensive coordinator for the Oklahoma Sooners. Weeksâ first NFL gig, after 21 years on the sidelines for 12 teams, ranging from junior high to four junior colleges, from Ellinwood, Kan. to Glendale, Ariz., was with the Raiders, when Rob was defensive coordinator. He worked for free, lived with Robâs family, and fellow assistants pooled their per-diems to help keep him afloat on the road. He then jumped to the Jets and lived in the attic area of Rexâs house while getting a divorce. He served as a defensive assistant for three years. At times, he clashed with coordinator Mike Pettine over his role with the team. Weeks felt marginalized under Pettine, and insisted that he performed all the tasks Pettine asked of him. Pettine is now defensive coordinator with the Buffalo Bills.

I want to stay as long as I can, but ultimately it is out of my control.â

This seems mostly to be a dog and pony show to distract from his more immediate and personal political problems,â he added.
