    <body>Yes, I love it! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?betagan.viagra.procalis.terazosin&quot;&gt;can rogaine grow hair faster&lt;/a&gt;  Okay. In the 3%, that is purely the Digital segment, and the Digital segment really only has in it our interest -- 100% of CareerBuilder, although then we have to take out the part we don&apos;t own in the minority, the old -- what we used to call minority interest line at the bottom, it includes PointRoll, ShopLocal and a couple of other small businesses. When we refer to all Digital revenues company-wide, for instance, in Dave&apos;s Broadcast division, they generate a lot of local Digital revenues. In Bob Dickey&apos;s local Publishing markets, we generate a huge amount of Digital revenues; similarly with Newsquest; similarly with other businesses. So what we do is we then look at all of those Digital revenues across the company and combine them. And so that&apos;s the difference between the 2. One is segment, one is the total company all-digital revenues.
