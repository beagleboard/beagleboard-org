    <body>In tens, please (ten pound notes) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/legaldrugsforsalecom-0bae.pdf#mouth&quot;&gt;legaldrugsforsale.com&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8220;The last major triptych by Bacon to come to auction was in 2008 when it was sold in New York for around 86 million dollars. That was a later painting, from the late 1970s, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t of a very iconic subject like Lucien Freud, so for many reasons I think this is a much more commercial and better painting, so I would confidently hope that this would break the 86 million dollars that was achieved for that painting,&amp;#8221; said Francis Outred, head of the Post-war and Contemporary Art auctions at Christie&amp;#8217;s.
