He missed three games earlier this season with a groin injury and that was listed on the injury report Wednesday, too. Tight end Rob Gronkowski, trying to come back from multiple surgeries to repair a broken forearm, has been practicing but not playing, which has become a controversial topic in New England. Aaron Hernandez is in jail.
