One cup of pumpkin provides 3 grams of fiber, which is very important if you&apos;re watching your weight. With all that flavor, you&apos;d think it would be higher in calories, but that&apos;s not the case: There are only 48 calories in a cup.

After a hard workout, think about refueling with pumpkin rather than a banana. Your sore muscles will love you! Pumpkin is also a great source of Vitamin C. With that impressive nutritional value and the equally great taste, how could you not want to buy six cans every grocery visit?
