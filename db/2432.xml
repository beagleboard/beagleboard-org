    <body>Nice to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;https://muktiforum.com/stmap_b18b0.html?imitrex.cialis.feldene.hindgra&quot;&gt;famvir 250mg&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;This week on &apos;VICE,&apos; we go to North Korea,&quot; opens Smith, at the start of the episode, with a smugness that suggests he has been waiting all season to say the phrase. His team, he explains, worked in &quot;official and back channels,&quot; to convince the basketball-loving Kim Jong Un to host them for a friendly exhibition game with some North Korean players. But Smith has to sit the trip out, due to his work on past documentaries about the remote country. Leading the expedition is &quot;VICE&quot; correspondent Ryan Duffy, who brings three members of the Harlem Globetrotters to play with him in the game.
