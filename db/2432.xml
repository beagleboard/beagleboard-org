His older brother Brian died in a bicycle accident after he was struck by a drunk driver when Peterson was 7. At 13, his dad Nelson was sent to prison for money-laundering from drug profits and spent eight years there. In 2007, the night before the NFL Combine, Petersonâs half-brother Chris Paris was shot and killed in Houston, but Peterson still participated in the combine.
