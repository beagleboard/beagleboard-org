    <body>Best Site good looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/acnetreatmentcomph-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmacoach.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;  Davis, the focus of much of the Metsâ struggles at the plate, was sent down in June to work on his swing after a second straight horrendous start to the season. Since rejoining the Mets on July 5, Davis has a .234 average. Davis has shown more patience, but Collins is waiting to see the player who finished with a career high 32 home runs and 90 RBI last season. âHe drew a couple walks, again. He is showing a little patience at the plate,â Collins said of Davis. âThe other two at-bats, he had some balls to hit and he fouled them off. Those are the balls heâs got to certainly put in play and see if he can do some damage.â
