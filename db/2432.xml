    <body>I have my own business &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/peach-and-lily-black-friday-sale-213a.pdf&quot;&gt;peach and lily store nyc&lt;/a&gt;  I&apos;m am really, really lucky that in my relationship, my now husband told me he loved me within about a week of us officially dating. Ha! Could he really mean it? But then he had known me already for about a year and so had, I guess, developed these feelings &apos;behind the scenes&apos;. He didn&apos;t expect me to say it back, either. Him saying it so early on, no strings attached, gave me the control, the confidence, of being able to wait a bit until I said it back, safe in the knowledge he meant it and I knew where he stood.
