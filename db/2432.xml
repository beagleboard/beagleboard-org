    <body>I work for myself &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/capracleanse-65ef.pdf#bonus&quot;&gt;capracleanse uk&lt;/a&gt;  Google is serving up the Moto X phone this week, with enthusiasm building toward the Android phone based on the sheer fact that it&amp;#8217;s from Google itself. And the timing couldn&amp;#8217;t be better or more needed. Samsung and HTC, the only two Android vendors whose U.S. sales amount to more than a rounding error, have both just warned that their Android sales this quarter are coming up short. Samsung just failed, by Samsung standards at least, with the disappointing sales of its Galaxy S4. HTC is failing on all counts, with its First a flop and its One merely middling. And no other Android vendors are picking up the sales slack, meaning that Android momentum has left the building. That places the burden squarely on the shoulders of Google, the ringleader of the once flourishing and suddenly endangered Android project, to bring momentum back to the stalled platform. And the Moto X may be just the ticket.
