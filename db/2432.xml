    <body>How do I get an outside line? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/imdur-rxlist-75b3.pdf&quot;&gt;imdur rxlist&lt;/a&gt;  I can understand the reliability aspect (they generally are), but unless you live in the middle of nowhere or have something else preventing you from jumping ship, you should. I get tired of the big 2 (AT&amp;T and Verizon) corroborating and finding new ways to rip people off (EDGE and NEXT). Verizon does not care about you. I once had a doctor come in with a BB Storm 2. He&apos;d gone through 5 or so replacements and rightfully wanted something else. Specifically he asked to be downgraded to a Curve, because he&apos;d miss calls from patients all the time due to the phone freezing, crashing, and dying. Verizon over the phone told me to tell him that he could leave them if he wanted, but they were not going to give him another phone.
