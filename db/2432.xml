    <body>Through friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/chase-medicalcom-e3c4.pdf&quot;&gt;medicare.pt&lt;/a&gt;  The Judge should be forced to retire.  His statement about the victim was &quot;older than her chronological age&quot; was nothing more than a blame the victiem for the crime.   His deep seated prejudices dont belong in a court room
