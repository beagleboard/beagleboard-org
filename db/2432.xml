The federal government shutdown could leave America&amp;#x2019;s craft brewers with a serious hangover. Stores will still offer plenty of suds. But the shutdown has closed an obscure agency that quietly approves new breweries, recipes and labels, which could create huge delays throughout the rapidly growing craft industry, whose customers expect a constant supply of inventive and seasonal beers. Brewery officials are frustrated that some of their new labels and a new recipe might be held up with the federal government shutdown. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau approves new breweries, recipes and labels. (AP Photo/Carrie Antlfinger)
