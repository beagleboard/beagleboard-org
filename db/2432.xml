    <body>I&apos;ve been cut off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.layeredonline.com/kbhpharmacycom-dd54.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmaccc.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;  The number of plays this offense hopes to get off and the rate at which it hopes to do so is going to wear down this offensive line over time. It&apos;s much easier to work at that pace with a bunch of 19- and 20-year-olds. But beat-up grown men with bad backs and aching knees, many of whom have kids and don&apos;t even catch a break when they get home from work? Not quite the same.

Teams have no reason to respect it and they can more readily defend the deep ball that has been the Giantsâ trademark. Basically, the Giants have lost their identity as an offense. Eli needs to get into a rhythm and he canât. Lance Briggs has been a monster for the Bears at weakside linebacker, and I donât see the Giants getting much done on the ground again. Marc Trestman has Jay Cutler playing with more awareness. Heâs had just one poor game against the Lions but otherwise has been pretty decisive. The Bears have struggled at times with blitz pickup. Perry Fewell isnât a big blitz guy. He may have to be.â

The petulent child who says if I can&amp;#8217;t pitch I&amp;#8217;ll take my ball and go home. If hewere not a lame duck and planned on running again do you really think he would not, at least, try to reach a solution. Wake up, we have a problem and its name is Obama.

That would give Smith 10 days to get ready to play the Bills at home and the Titans on the road, two games in which the Jets should be competitive. Or maybe Ryan waits until the bye week, which comes after the ninth game and follows a brutal stretch against the Falcons, Steelers, Patriots, Bengals and Saints.
