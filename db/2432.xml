I was very young. Actually the first year I was in New York, I met Martha Graham. She said, &quot;Well, Mr. Wilson what do you want to do in life?&quot; I was 21 years old and I said, &quot;I have no idea.&quot; And she said, &quot;If you work long enough and hard enough, you&apos;ll find something.&quot; And oddly enough, this very simple thing that she said so often has come back to me.
