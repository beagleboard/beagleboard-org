They will nudge in every case where some lawyer could make even a barely plausible justification that it&amp;#8217;s legal. They will nudge you in every case where it&amp;#8217;s flat out illegal but they figure they won&amp;#8217;t get caught, or they won&amp;#8217;t get caught before they make some money, or they will get caught but won&amp;#8217;t get sanctioned enough to make it a money losing proposition. The hell with nudges.

And even so, Google warns that the Chromecast may &quot;may get hot to the touch; this is normal,&quot; iFixit notes.
