New York&apos;s premium figuresannounced on Wednesday do not include these subsidies.

The multitasking screen represents the saved state of the app from the last time you used it. With some exceptions, apps on the mutitasking screen aren&apos;t actually running any background processes, and the apps that do run background processes won&apos;t be stopped by turning them &quot;off&quot; in the multitasking screen. You can easily test this in Mail. Double-click on the home button, and drag Mail off. Then send a mail to yourself to an address that uses push notifications (such as iCloud). You&apos;ll see the receipt badge appear on your home screen even though you just &quot;turned Mail off.&quot; A lot of things were changed in iOS7, but this hasn&apos;t.

At least four police officers have been killed in shootouts with gunmen in Michoacan since Thursday.

Predictably, on WCBS-AM John (Pa Pinstripe) Sterling dusted off his tired âItâs an A-Bomb...â call (more fitting would be âItâs a Juicer Joltâ) and Suzyn (Ma Pinstripe) Waldman reprised her Clemensesque shtick, gushing: âOh my, he does have a flair for the dramatic.â
