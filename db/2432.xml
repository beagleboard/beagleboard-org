    <body>US dollars &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/mmemorialhealthcom-e0f9.pdf&quot;&gt;sellsteroidraws.com&lt;/a&gt;  There is no virtue in irresponsibly raising debt limits every year and refusal to cut back. The U.S. cannot pay the interest on its debt at this very moment. (U.S. debt is &amp;#8220;borrowed&amp;#8221; in the form of bonds &amp;#8212; they don&amp;#8217;t go to a bank) If you could not pay the interest on your mortgage or your credit cards&amp;#8230; your credit would cease (you could not borrow) and you&amp;#8217;d have to pay DOWN most of your debt or go BK &amp;#8230; WE CAN SEE Europe already failing (PIIGS = Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain but we know France and Romania, Yugoslav states (Balkans), most of L. America and parts of Asia are failing due to socialism and borrowing. Who will bail us out? It is EASIER to cut back now than to have a Depression WORSE than the 1930&amp;#8242;s
