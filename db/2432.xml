 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/michigan-health-marketplacenet-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;meds4world.net&lt;/a&gt;  President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize for what he was EXPECTED TO DO &amp;#8211; not for anything he actually achieved other than becoming the first black U.S. president. So now he has a chance to be a statesman and what does he do? Does he negotiate and collaborate with Putin &amp;#8211; like Bush did with some success? No. Does he try to arrange a cease fire in Syria? No. He does what most American presidents tend to do &amp;#8211; bomb the hell out of Syria&amp;#8230;by remote control. Now he has a chance to get rid of Syria&amp;#8217;s poison gas &amp;#8211; ALL OF IT &amp;#8211; and with Putin&amp;#8217;s help! Did Obama suggest this? No. Putin did. Why did the Russian president have to suggest a statesmanlike approach to prevent Obama from committing technically an act of war. Bombing another country, even as punishment, without U.N. sanctions, is technically an act of war. And worse than that, it takes America into ANOTHER war without knowing the consequences (Syria&amp;#8217;s Assad has said there WILL be consequences). So does Obama earn his peace prize, or ignore peace and choose war? We will see very soon.
