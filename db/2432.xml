    <body>I want to report a  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/paracetamol-500-mg-50-tabletek-cena-e0f9.pdf#whispering&quot;&gt;paracetamol al comp kosten&lt;/a&gt;  I&amp;#8217;m confused. How can there ever be a &amp;#8216;TWO STATE SOLUTION&amp;#8217; when there are in fact THREE STATES (ie West Bank, Israel, and Gaza). Folks, geography is everything. People form governments and ideologies within geographic entities. Remember back when India was partitioned and there were supposedly Two States, ie India and Pakistan, but &amp;#8216;Pakistan&amp;#8217; actually had an East Pakistan and a West Pakistan? Well folks, that didn&amp;#8217;t work. Each geographical entity worked out it&amp;#8217;s own political destiny and the two &amp;#8220;Pakistans&amp;#8221; ended up splitting into two countries &amp;#8211; ie Pakistan and Bangladesh. This should be a lesson. The only way a two state solution can come about in the mid-east is if there were to be a POPULATION EXCHANGE between Gaza nad the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Then all the Palestinians will be within the contiguous borders of the West Bank and all the Jews will be within the contiguous borders of an Israel which includes Gaza. There is no other way to the mythical, phantasmagorical, &amp;#8216;Two State Solution&amp;#8217;.
