    <body>Whereabouts are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssvoverath.de/stmap_c3db0.html?bimatoprost.aristocort.estrace.viagra&quot;&gt;finaflex revolution test stack supplements&lt;/a&gt;  My best piece of advice to would-be exporters is to be strategic. Originally, we weren&amp;rsquo;t. In the early days of G&amp;B&amp;rsquo;s, we were flattered into selling small amounts of chocolate to anyone who wanted it: Slovenia, Estonia, Finland. You do a small dance of joy, discovering that someone in, say, Belarus loves your brand. &apos;Til logistical reality kicks in&amp;hellip; When we took private equity investment in the year 2000, after nine years, the first thing the new financial director did was take a big red pen to our export book &amp;ndash; and he was dead right: with translations, import restrictions and other legalities to contend with, each teeny market was as much work as the ones we could send entire containers to &amp;ndash; like Australia, New Zealand, the States. The new focus was on those, and it worked: less effort, bigger returns.
