Some news organisations led by describing her as a former Marxist guerrilla tripped up by her support for abortion. Reuters described Rousseff as âthe hand-picked successor to President Lula who has pledged to continue policies that have made Brazil one of worldâs hottest emerging markets.âÂ The contrast is between the personal interest and the immediate versus the âso whatâ and the âwhat next.â Rousseff was duly elected in the second round as the importance of social issues to voters fell away.
