The Democrats/Liberals/Progressives and their lackies in the Park Service are cordoning off these memorials to purposely try and inconvenience tourists and those wishing to pay their respects to those that have fallen in defense of this Country. These people have no shame. WWII veterans who would unlikely be able to make a second trip were almost thwarted from a memorial they waited too long to see raised in their honor and viewed in person. You on the left make me sick.

It also aims to oppose marijuana&apos;s continued federal status as a dangerous narcotic with no legitimate medical applications, said Vivian McPeak, the event&apos;s longtime executive director.

He also talked about how Trayvon had gone up to visit his campus more than once with him because he respected his older brother and wanted to follow him to college. Not exactly a thug thing to do is it?. ...more like a normal middle class thing.
