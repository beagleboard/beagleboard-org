    <body>Thanks funny site &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/what-does-go-shake-your-ears-mean-2206.pdf#detach&quot;&gt;what does go shake your ears mean&lt;/a&gt;  And on and on it went for the team with the Super Bowl countdown clock hanging in the locker room. There was Manning with what&apos;s become a weekly rite of passage, throwing his eighth interception of the season on the first drive of the third quarter, when Melvin White jumped in front of Victor Cruz. There was Rueben Randle letting Manning&apos;s picture-perfect 48-yard deep pass go straight through his hands later on in the period. There was rookie Damontre Moore, eagerly jumping offsides on a Panthers punt at the start of the first quarter, a penalty that gave Carolina first down and set up Newton&apos;s 47-yard rainbow TD to Ted Ginn, giving the Panthers a monstrous 38-0 lead.
