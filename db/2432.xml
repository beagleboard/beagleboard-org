    <body>Have you got a telephone directory? &lt;a href=&quot;http://teerandaz.com/stmap_131c0.html?viagra.dapoxetine.lignocaine.ofloxacin&quot;&gt;cmc pharmacy residency&lt;/a&gt;  When CNBC reported that Government officials visited the war shrine, an attack on the Japanese Yen consistent with foreign government intervention occurred (n.b., occurred just after 10:00 PM Eastern Standard Time), which strengthened the Yen in a manner adverse to the economic aims of the Central Bank/Government and dramatically lowered the Nikkei 225. In short, when a foreign government who opposes a weaker yen surreptitiously intervenes to advance their interests, a case can be made that Japan would benefit from the Japanese Central Bank countering the action of that foreign government by clandestinely intervening to weaken the yen. Only the Japanese Central Bank has the balance sheet required to effectively stand up against another country; and fortunately, the Constitution does not prevent Japan from defending itself against this type of foreign attack.
