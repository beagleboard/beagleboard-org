Maybe someday in football there will be a remarkable family like Archieâs and Olivia Manningâs, the father once a great quarterback himself, Peyton winning a Super Bowl and being MVP and Eli winning the next one and being MVP, and then Eli doing it again.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/rx-one-pharmacy-altamonte-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;taking prescription drugs to portugal&lt;/a&gt;  Sometimes I wonder what yardstick the global finacial organisations like IMF and others use to measure classes of incomes in Africa. Imagine, IMF and World Bank recently claimed that Ghana has attained middle income status which is contrary to the situation on the ground. The Ghanaian government about two years ago was boasting of his economic achievements in relation to the IMF assertion that Ghana has reached the middle status. In connection to that, a government official was asked on an interview about the standard used in measuring the middle income status within the country and he made a claim that yes indeed Ghana is now a middle income country because now an ordinary Ghanaian could afford to buy second-hand television set and fried rice. So I asked myself how can a government official who holds a doctorate degree in economics could make such a statement? Do we benchmark the measurement of the income classes in the country with the Western world or is ours different? Because I know for sure that in Western Europe these things that he was attributing the middle income status are insignificant with regards to the measuring of income classes.
