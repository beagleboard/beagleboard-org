It should be a case by case review. Just like you can&amp;#8217;t convict someone on presumption that they have been doing it all along, you need to just prove one instance.

Such nonsense. Glad I don&amp;#8217;t live in Boston they are going to have a free-for-all with that many criminals set loose. Good luck Boston!
