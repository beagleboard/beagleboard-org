    <body>When can you start? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikasafloors.com/stmap_bdec0.html?proagra.urispas.levitra&quot;&gt;comprar fluconazole online&lt;/a&gt;  But there are almost certainly other factors in play. As with surviving the Titanic disaster, good luck may play a role. Some people may simply wind up in circumstances that defend them against obesity. In some cases, it is personal commitment and resolve â and hard work. In some, there is defense at the level of genes. We are learning more and more about genetic variation â both our own and that of our resident microbes â with implications for energy balance and weight regulation. Some of us are genetically more disposed to gain weight, others less. Those at the extreme of the bell curve may find weight gain nearly impossible; most of us know a person or two like that, although they are very much in the minority.
