However, total cost for CNG vehicles has to come down significantly before mass adoption will take place. As stated in the article, $10,000 additional cost for the vehicle (at 25,000 miles annually, that cost is recovered in about six years&amp;#8211;150,000 miles). If you add the cost of a home fill system ($4,500) you will have to keep your vehicle for as many as ten years to breakeven. Breakeven needs to get to 5 years before the average consumer will be motivated to make the cutover from conventional fuels.

Even if enforcing net neutrality &quot;wouldn&apos;t lead to some dramatic effects, I think opening that kind of door to the FCC probably would.&quot; Public Knowledge&amp;rsquo;s Sherwin Siy also says it&amp;rsquo;s likely a more philosophical decision than a practical one. &quot;I think Verizon just takes a harder line when it comes to this kind of regulation,&quot; he says, compared to other ISPs.
