    <body>Have you got any experience? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/steel-1-andro-e0f9.pdf#captivity&quot;&gt;steel 1 andro&lt;/a&gt;  Restraint is definitely an issue in âThe Butler.â At no time does the director shy from hitting you over the head with a concept. Thereâs a touching, pivotal scene that sees Gaines and his wife, played with marginal success by Oprah Winfrey, returning to the scene of his turbulent childhood, in an attempt to make peace with the past. This could have been a good scene had the costume department not decided that no one will possibly be able to tell that itâs the eighties if the characters arenât wearing day-glo track suits. Again, pulls you right out of the movie.
