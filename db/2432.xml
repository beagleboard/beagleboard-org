We&apos;ve got a little headwind but we&apos;ve got plenty of upside,&quot; he said. &quot;The ultimate measure of a place has got to be what happens with profits. As a shareholder I will hold us accountable for continuing to focus in on good short-term results and at the same time making investments that give us an opportunity to generate someday another $10, $15, $20, $25 billion of incremental profit.&quot;

Myanmar&apos;s military shelled suspected KIA positions; the rebels retaliated with ambushes along the Hpakant road. Thousands of people were displaced. Jade production plunged to just 19.08 million kg in the 2012/13 fiscal year from 43.1 million kg the previous year.

Once he returned to his normal habitat, the bullpen, Rivera said later, he was dearly hoping he would be getting the âEnter Sandman&quot; call for real, in a save situation. And for the first five innings, as Pettitte threatened to steal some of the spotlight by pitching no-hit ball and nursing a 1-0 lead, that looked to be a strong possibility. The Giants had scored only one run in the first two games and looked like a team that had packed it in after a week in New York, and Pettitte was locked in.
