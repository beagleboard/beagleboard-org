    <body>I like watching football &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdesighn.com/nugenix-natural-testosterone-b26f.pdf&quot;&gt;nugenix gnc malaysia&lt;/a&gt;  It&amp;rsquo;s not healthy,&amp;rsquo; my Out Of Work Actress friend says, frowning. &apos;Every couple should argue. It&amp;rsquo;s a sign that they still care.&amp;rsquo; And yet my husband and I don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; argue, I mean. Never have done. I say this without smugness, I tell her (I suspect that I&amp;rsquo;m simply too lazy and he&amp;rsquo;s too busy tweeting to notice my litany of irritating habits). This flippancy doesn&amp;rsquo;t go down well. Neither does my suggestion that she &apos;take that to her therapist to chew on&amp;rsquo;. I wonder if she knows that therapy is turning her into a prize bore? It was bad enough when she was working on her identity issues (quite how any actor can ever be cured of multiple distinct personality disorder is beyond me). Now that she and her husband have begun &apos;argument clinic&amp;rsquo;, every Friday, the pious psychojargon is becoming quite intolerable.

The rest of us will go on living in reality.

But the eight article decree, issued late in June, bars women from leaving home without a male relative, while shutting cosmetic shops on the pretext they were being used for prostitution - an accusation residents and police reject. &quot;There is no way these shops could have stayed open. Shops are for business, not adultery,&quot; Enayatullah Baligh, a member of the top religious panel, the Ulema Council, and an adviser to the president, told Reuters late on Friday. Residents of Deh Salah described the order as a &quot;fatwa&quot;, or religious edict, although only senior clerics in Kabul should issue such a binding religious order.
