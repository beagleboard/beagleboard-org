A UK Border Agency handler and dog located seven storage units that were later found to contain tobacco. Mo arrived during the intervention at the self storage site and he held keys to four of the seven units. In the seven units 8.5 tons of hand rolled tobacco and 7,800 cigarettes were discovered. Mo failed to appear at court and is now wanted by HMRC and also by UKBA for immigration offences. The estimated cost to the taxpayer of his tax evasion is more than Â£2.6m.
