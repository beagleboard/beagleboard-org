In charge of both projects, the director Justin Way here not only found economically expressive gestures but engaged with the whole building, conjuring up from the circular Albert Hall, with its columns and dome, a sort of grail temple. Not many opera houses can deliver the ranked choruses required by Wagner, and here the boys&amp;rsquo; and youth choirs (perhaps a little too English in tone for this music) were placed up in the gallery alongside some brass to thrilling effect, while the Royal Opera Chorus anchored things down on the stage.
