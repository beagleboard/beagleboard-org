My job is to coach him and make sure something like what happened doesn&apos;t happen again. But at the end of the day, he&apos;s got to do the right thing by J.R. and his teammates and me as a coach in this organization and the fans that support him. That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about. He&apos;s got to grow up and do the right things.&quot;
