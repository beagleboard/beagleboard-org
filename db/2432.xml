    <body>Who&apos;s calling? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/nexium-40-mg-twice-daily-79a8.pdf&quot;&gt;nexium fda approval date&lt;/a&gt;  Recently, an 88-year old man (Mr. Delbert Belton) in Spokane, Wash. was brutally murdered by two black teenagers. Apparently, Mr. Belton (a white man) was simply going to a local pool hall to spend time with friends. I certainly hope that the American media (including The Day) reports on this case with the exact same ferocity as it did the Trayvon Martin case. Otherwise, I would be left to think that the media believes that racial crimes can only be committed by white persons, or that the barbaric murder of an 88-year old veteran of WWII and the Battle of Okinawa is insignificant and not newsworthy to the extent of Martin/George Zimmerman.
