    <body>I&apos;ve just graduated &lt;a href=&quot;https://oporajeyo.com/stmap_bf450.html?praziquantel.cialis.atorvastatin.aceon&quot;&gt;neogyn ointment&lt;/a&gt;  The number of dead in Syria has now crossed the Rubicon of statistics. Last month the United Nations estimated that this number is well over 100,000. Yet, in an act of neobarbarism the foreign policy team of the current American administration is laser focused only on the over 1,000 killed by chemical weapons. This use of chemical weapons is an absolute travesty and is a crime against humanity. However, what of the deaths by shell and shot? These have become mere statistics, in a 21st century obsessed with numbers to replace judgment. It conjures up dark memories of the most evil character of the 20th century, Josef Stalin, who notoriously stated, &amp;ldquo;A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.&amp;rdquo; We can and should be horrified by the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime; they have broken any protection of sovereignty and must be destroyed. However, the complete absence of horror for the 100,000 dead is unbelievable. Is the United States truly prepared to make the case that we will narrowly punish a sliver of a rogue regime by tacitly accepting the deaths in the tens of thousands that have already occurred? I have stated on four other occasions that international realists and liberals should come together over Syria. The country is a quasi-client of the Russians, an ally of the Iranians, destabilizer of Lebanon, threat to Israel and a major state sponsor of terrorism. These reasons serve the realist notions of vital and national interest. Liberals, horrified by the immorality of the Assad regime, must see that negotiation with a tyrant who kills his own people is an act of moral cowardice. The Syrian regime is an enemy of the civilized world, an enemy of the American state, and an enemy to her own people.

The British actress was the daughter of theatrical royalty, but also won much acclaim on her own for her work on the stage, in film and on television. Peers have called her &apos;one of the greatest actresses of her generation.&apos;
