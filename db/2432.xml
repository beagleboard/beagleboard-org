How glycogen &amp;ndash; a molecule that turns into energy &amp;ndash; synthesizes really depends on the type of carbohydrate you&apos;re eating. The closer it is to its simplest form, glucose, the easier it will be to break down and use as fuel. That&apos;s why high-glycemic index foods like potatoes, whole-wheat pastas or breads, and rice refuel muscles better than fructose. It&apos;s important to consume protein as well because it enhances both glycogen replacement and muscle reparation in the initial hours after exercise. Below are lists with sources of protein, my favorite meal options and quick ideas to restore carbs and proteins.

Swing hasn&amp;#039;t been quite right. And a combination of those has led to, I guess, sloppy play, just because of not being sharp enough,&quot; said McIlroy, who is looking forward to a run of six events in eight weeks including the defence of his US PGA title at Oak Hill in August.
