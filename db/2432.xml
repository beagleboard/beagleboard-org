Hood said the new reporting structure - which essentially separates consumer and commercial business, and then divides revenue streams between hardware and software licensing - would begin at its next earnings in October, and was aimed at giving more insight into the company&apos;s economic approach.

But itâs hard not to wonder what creative visionaries like Fincher and Sorkin (who is busy adapting Walter Isaacsonâs best-selling biography of Jobs) might have done with the same material.

She was assigned to the White House in 1961 in part because of the great interest in first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, as well as the new young president. She became UPI White House bureau chief in 1974, the first woman to head a wire service bureau there. She stayed in that position until 2000 when she joined Hearst.
