When federal prosecutors failed to act this spring, MLB filed a tortious interference lawsuit in Florida state court against Bosch and his business associates, as well as Nunez, which gave baseball lawyers the ability to subpoena testimony and documents. Bosch then began cooperating with MLB and his testimony forms a large part of the cases against the players who will be suspended.
