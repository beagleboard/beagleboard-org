    <body>I like it a lot &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/which-is-better-children39s-tylenol-or-ibuprofen-9e88.pdf&quot;&gt;is it ok to take ibuprofen and oxycodone together&lt;/a&gt;  In an incident entirely typical of this cull, the gunman was helped to do his job by the police, who conveniently prevented me from doing mine. On both occasions, officers held me for far longer than it was necessary, to establish I was not breaking any law. This delay enabled the badger cullers to drive away into the darkness and continue their work without having to suffer the terror of a journalist politely stammering, &quot;Excuse me sir, how is the badger cull going?&quot;
