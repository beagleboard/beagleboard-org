Meaning, kill anyone who could possibly donate. Last week, Fornell has been been assigned to protect him because Mendez was on the hit list they stumbled upon last week, which turned out to be a red herring. Just before Mendez detonated another bomb using his cell phone, Gibbs took him out (and accidentally shot Fornell in the ass).
