In a time of financial scarcity for most, the best way to do that is with humility and a dash of populism in making the right bold bets that everyone can rally behind.

Concerns? I always have concerns. Our division is very good. Jerry Reese on the other hand is always positive. Tells me to âstay in the boat.â Last season was bitterly disappointing, especially because we had such a big lead in the division at one point and then donât even make the playoffs, and get blown out by Atlanta and Baltimore.â
