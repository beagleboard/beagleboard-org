    <body>I&apos;ve just started at  &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtual-operations.com/wwwschroeder-medishopde-92e2.pdf#outer&quot;&gt;www.schroeder-medishop.de&lt;/a&gt;  This time the Giants were close to taking it. With 1:54 to play, they trailed 27-21 as Manning dropped back on second-and-9 from the Bearsâ 35, desperately searching for a receiver. He thought he had found one in tight end Brandon Myers, who had floated near the Chicago 13, and he fired. But the pass was a touch high, hitting the hands of a leaping Myers and falling into the waiting hands of corner Tim Jennings, sealing the game for the Bears and wrecking a drive that had started at the Giantsâ 11 with 5:21 left, one that had looked so reminiscent of those game-winning Manning drives of old.
