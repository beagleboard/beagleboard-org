The 34-year-old actor got engaged to model girlfriend of two years Renee Puente on June 27, 2013, a source revealed to Us Weekly. Morrison&apos;s pals Elton John and his husband David Furnish were the ones to blow the lid on the exciting news, announcing it during John&apos;s White Tie and Tiara Ball to benefit his AIDS Foundation in London, an insider told the mag. &quot;I&apos;m very happy.

And yet to his amazement, rather than booing him off, the audience couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough of this madcap idiot and he won the £250 prize.
