Most lawmakers across the Capitol &amp;#8212; including those who said only a few days ago they didn&amp;#8217;t think it was likely &amp;#8212; now believe a short-term shutdown is nearly certain. The bigger question is not whether the government will have a partial shutdown, but for how long? A short-term shutdown is the most likely outcome, perhaps a matter of hours or days.
