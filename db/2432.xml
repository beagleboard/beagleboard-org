Apparently commercial fruit orchards add calcium now, too, which stops trees growing, allowing the growth to lignify. Sibley also recommends following this with a winter prune, when you can thin the fruiting blossoms to regulate your crop. However, for standard (as opposed to restricted) apple and pear trees, he advocates winter pruning, to create the structure and architecture, with a follow-up of a light, early-summer pruning (before the longest day) to thin or rub out any crowded shoots.Plums, cherries and stone fruit are different: most pruning is carried out after fruiting but before the end of August.

We already have massive investment from off shore in our utilities and household budgets are straining to keep money flowing OUT of the country. Surely there is a lesson to learn there? Some things cannot be left to foreign or commercial investment deals - I strongly suggest that energy security is at the very top of that list!
