    <body>Could I ask who&apos;s calling? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/ashp-pharmacy-leadership-academy-0bae.pdf#annoy&quot;&gt;ashp pharmacy week 2016&lt;/a&gt;  An outdoor gallery alongside the new building will play host to three reconstructed Neolithic houses, made with walls of chalk cob over a willow framework and topped by thatched roofs. &apos;They are based on some houses excavated at the nearby henge of Durrington Walls,&amp;rsquo; Susan Greaney, an archaeologist and the museum&amp;rsquo;s curator, says. &apos;They date from 2500bc, the same time as the large sarsen stones were being raised at Stonehenge and probably where the builders of Stonehenge lived. It will be a real hands-on, immersive experience. We hope the exhibition will show that the prehistoric people who built and used Stonehenge were sophisticated and clever. They were able to pool together vast resources to construct this extraordinary monument using only simple tools.&amp;rsquo;
