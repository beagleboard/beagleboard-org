    <body>I&apos;m happy very good site &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?catapres.cialis.cystone&quot;&gt;wellbutrin cost no insurance&lt;/a&gt;  Of course, there are dozens of ways in which a mutual fund can fail. Perhaps the most basic is that it can underperform its peer group in a particular year. But Bogle was talking about failure in a different sense &amp;ndash; a more permanent sense. The problem that he was highlighting wasn&apos;t the mutual funds that don&apos;t sufficiently reward investors, but rather mutual funds that are dropping off the map entirely, whether by liquidating or merging away into other products.
