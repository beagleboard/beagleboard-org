So you want an incentive system that prevents that. The most effective incentive system that I&amp;#8217;ve heard of to prevent major screw-ups is what&amp;#8217;s used by the military, where punishment for mistakes often goes to the whole team, even when it&amp;#8217;s clear who&amp;#8217;s to blame for it. This creates some really intense peer pressure to avoid screw-ups, and people watch each other on that. From that point of view, the best bonus system would be one that works like this: If the company had a bad year, nobody gets a bonus. Even if it&amp;#8217;s only one department that caused the problem. If the company had a good year, bonuses can be related to individual performance.

You saw it again on Thursday night at Soldier Field when the Giants went to 0-6 against the Bears, would be called the worst team in the sport right now if it werenât for the Jaguars.
