    <body>Which year are you in? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lovemycase.com/does-ibuprofen-inhibit-blood-clotting-f2c2.pdf&quot;&gt;ibuprofen aspirin drug interaction&lt;/a&gt;  - Davey Johnsonâs last season as a manager is starting to end badly. Who wouldâve ever believed his Washington Nationals, heavily favored to win the National League East, would be four games under .500 entering Saturdayâs play? Even in their best win of the year, Thursday on Bryce Harperâs walk-off homer against the Pirates, Johnson couldnât fully celebrate as heâd incurred his first ejection of the season. And now there are reports of a divided clubhouse and friction between him and GM Mike Rizzo over the firing of hitting coach Rick Eckstein, who was Daveyâs guy. The Nationals rank 28th in the majors in runs and arenât likely to have a single player with 100 RBI. Their principal set-up man, Drew Storen, has five blown saves with a 5.40 ERA and is likely headed to the minors, and theyâre holding their breath to see whatâs in store for No. 3 starter Gio Gonzalez in the Biogenesis investigation. Worst of all, however, is the effect all this is having on the Papa Johnâs Pizza 50% off deal, in which the pizza company is offering half price on all their pizzas in games in which the Nationals win and score seven or more runs. So far, the Nats have qualified only 17 times, a decrease of 24% from last year.
