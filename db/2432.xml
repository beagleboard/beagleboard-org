The environmental activist, 52, whose life story as a legal clerk leading a landmark class action lawsuit was turned into an Oscar-winning film, was arrested on June 7, 2013 after she was said to have drunkenly drove her boat on a Nevada lake. She was discovered to have had more than twice the legal .08 blood alcohol limit after she had trouble docking her boat on Lake Mead near Las Vegas, authorities said. She was later released on $1,000 bond. &quot;At no time was the boat away from the dock and there was no public safety risk,&quot; Brockovich said in a statement, according to People magazine. &quot;That being said, I take drunk driving very seriously, this was clearly a big mistake.
