Ryan Tanehill only threw 12 touchdowns last year, but his number 2 reciever wasn&amp;#8217;t respected past 7 yards by a defense. Who was the 3rd reciver? Ok then. He also threw 3 ints in his first game as a pro, all of which were batted in the air by JJ Swatt. Miami&amp;#8217;s defense didn&amp;#8217;t force a ton of turnovers, and the secondary wasn&amp;#8217;t terribly good, but they were 7th overall. They missed 3 easy field goals that cost them games. I&amp;#8217;ve never been a big Ireland fan, but I think they are picking up the pieces they need and not just names. I agree with you about Brady though. He is very good. I guess we just wait and see. If the new Dolphins pass rush, and faster cover LB&amp;#8217;s and slow him down.
