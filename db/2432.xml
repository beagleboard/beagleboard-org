And it is not easy.

How many times is any tournament shootout, let alone a major, decided on the eighth and ninth holes? Thatâs where Dufner took a two-shot lead on Furyk, never to give it back. It was a great display of shot-making. He had 10 one-putts, including three tap-in birdies. He may have made two closing bogeys but he was never seriously threatened.
