This report includes encouraging news about teen passengers, who are often left out of the teen driver safety picture,â says Dennis Durbin, M.D., M.S.C.E., co-scientific director of the Center for Injury Research and Prevention at CHOP, and lead author of the report. âWhen you see the needle move, as we have in this report, itâs time to apply the gas on programs that encourage safe teen passenger behaviors, as well as those that address what causes teens to crash.â
