False prophets tag also applies to Loeb. More capital does NOT mean better projects, more projects or anything necessarily positive, other than a brief stock surge. Dreamworks showed how tough it is to succeed in this business even when you start out with a zillion bucks and the best Director in the world. Clooney has earned our respect (regardless of which side of the aisle you&amp;#8217;re on) because he&amp;#8217;s ACTED and PRODUCED and WRITTEN projects. So he understands at a fine grain level how this town works. Loeb I&amp;#8217;m guessing: not so much. Other then a pump and dump, what is Loeb actually offering here?
