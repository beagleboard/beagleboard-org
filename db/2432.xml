But this spare form lets listeners appreciate the essential beauty of the tunes and the richness of Stingâs poetry. The lyrics to âPractical Arrangementâ have a conversational realism thatâs nearly Sondheimian. While the starâs more literary writing in a pop context can seem self-conscious, here itâs right at home. He captures both the hardness of the shipping life and the fatalism of the characters.
