    <body>I work here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/comprar-viagra-generico-barato-6865.pdf#gurgle&quot;&gt;prix viagra 25 mg comprim pellicul bote de 4&lt;/a&gt;  Obama ran on promising to reform our healthcare. He won the election and reformed healthcare using a Republican plan. Republicans refused to participate in negotiations and instead focused on obstructing the process, including lying about the the legislation. They failed. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed and became law. Republicans next challenged it in court. The Supreme Court declared it constitutional. We had another election. Obama vowed to protect the new law and Romney vowed to repeal the law that HE installed in Massachusetts as governor. Obama won the election. Then the Republicans threatened to shut down the government if Obama didn&amp;#8217;t agree to defunding it and when Obama said no, they shut down the government. Next they threatened to force us into defaulting on our debt obligations, which is where we are now. So far Obama is not giving in to their extortionist demands and Thursday the default will begin (I believe I have my timing right on that.) It won&amp;#8217;t happen all at once. Thursday will just mark the 1st day we can&amp;#8217;t pay all of our obligations, which are bills that Congress ran up. Today the DOW dropped 133 points. If Congress continues their extortion, tomorrow&amp;#8217;s stock market drop will be much worse, and everyone&amp;#8217;s 401Ks will be hurt. It will be a slow crumbling of our economy.
