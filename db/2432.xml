The bemused reaction by Republican candidates was followed shortly thereafter by the Obama administration&apos;s announcement of the employer contraception/sterilization coverage mandate under the Affordable Care Act, and followed not long afterward by accusations from Team Obama about a Republican &quot;war on women&quot; for opposing the mandate. Stephanopoulos works for ABC, however, and not NBC or CNN &amp;mdash; and furthermore used to work for Bill Clinton as a campaign adviser and later as a policy adviser during the first Clinton term.

That was followed by another armed robbery days later in the same city. In Paris&apos; wealthy Place Vendome on Sept. 9, thieves drove a sport utility vehicle into a jewelry store, grabbed 2 million euros ($2.7 million) worth of loot, then set the vehicle on fire and escaped.
