    <body>Have you seen any good films recently? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/stmap_ab8a0.html?cialis.vibramycin.montelukast&quot;&gt;healthwest community pharmacy ireland&lt;/a&gt;  Chicago mayor and formerÂ Obama adviser Rahm Emanuel&apos;s ill-timed posit that one should never let a serious crisis go to waste describes seeking opportunity in chaos. Obama inherited the serious mess of the post 9/11 security paranoia in all its overreaction, mistakes and squandered resources. His misfortune has been wasting a great post-cold war opportunity to refashion and reset the tenor and direction of a still robust U.S. leadership internationally out of ideological distaste. Instead of showing contrition for sins of commission he should have focused on recovering the best aspects of U.S. multilateral leadership, rooted in coalition building, and develop a new model of leadership by example &amp;ndash; not by words but by deeds.
