It is not clear however whether Russian willingness to cooperate with the U.S. on chemical weapons will lap over to convening the &amp;#8220;Geneva II&amp;#8221; conference, which has been stalled for months. In accordance with the Geneva I agreement of June 2012, it is supposed to transfer all executive power away from Bashar al-Assad and give it to a mutually agreed upon interim government. Moscow doesn&amp;#8217;t seem at all ready for that. Passage and implementation of a U.N. Security Council resolution in support of the chemical weapons agreement is likely to take up most diplomatic bandwidth for several more weeks, and perhaps more.
