    <body>How long are you planning to stay here? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bombeirodf.com.br/stmap_50f80.html?rumalaya.levitra.reglan&quot;&gt;cbd lab pure hemp extraction&lt;/a&gt;  I suppose the scientists will find multiple factors which may contribute to the epidemic of obesity which has spread through western civilization. The single largest component of the epidemic is behavior; being even minimally aware of basic nutrition and simple concepts like &amp;#8220;eating more calories than I burn will cause weight gain&amp;#8221;. People are responsible for the choices they make and they generally bear the consequences of this choice. These genes were there for centuries but this epidemic is new. We live in a world where people have been absolved of the daily struggle to survive and they have nearly unfettered access to food; both healthy foods and unhealth ones. Real exercise is purely optional. We no longer need to toil all day long to meet basic needs like food and shelter. Heck, you don&amp;#8217;t need to toil at all if you&amp;#8217;re willing to accept government hand-outs and snap cards.
