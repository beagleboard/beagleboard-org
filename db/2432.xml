Theo Walcott enjoyed his most fruitful season in an Arsenal shirt last term, netting 14 league goals while also providing 10 assists. Now an England regular, the former Southampton starlet has added an end product to his game, something that was in doubt just a couple of years ago. Hopefully for the Emirates faithful, he will be lining up alongside the likes of Gonzalo Higuain and Wayne Rooney next term. At Â£5.1M, he may not be recognised as a snip, but if he is able to repeat his efforts of last season, then it should be considered money well spent.

Corrected by increasing the predators. The current Lake Michigan plan is to reduce predators to increase invasive planktivores (alewives) there is no way this is helping reduce algae blooms, or our invasive species problem.
