But conferences are still important occasions and can transform political careers. Take, for example, David Cameron&apos;s powerful speech to the Conservative Party conference in 2005. The response was that DC became an instant hit and all the activists in the conference hall knew they were looking at a future leader. In short, his speech was a complete game changer in the party leadership contest that was under way that autumn. Two years later, Cameron ended his leader&apos;s speech by daring Gordon Brown to call the general election straight away. The result of not responding to David Cameron&apos;s helpful suggestion can be seen in an immediate down turn in the polls for Labour at that point in time. William&apos;s Hague&apos;s speech as a teenager to conference has gone into the annuls of party political history. William has gone on to be party leader and is now the UK&apos;s Foreign Secretary, so making an early appearance on the political stage paid off well for him in the long term.

Several screens flashed &quot;service advisory&quot; explaining that there would be train issues &quot;until further notice.&quot; Echoing through most people&apos;s mind: Get there early or stand and wait.
