We think that we can do better by delaying this law,&quot; he said.

He came here, heâs been here longer than I have. Heâs the big-play guy for God knows how long, and heâs just our leader, man . . . in the locker room and the receiving corps, heâs our leader.

James should be able to understand users who have no prior knowledge about the robot and who have not been briefed in any way. In the noisy environment of a night club, the system cannot rely on its language components only. Thus, the robot learns how to interpret body language. &apos;Currently, we are working on the robot&apos;s ability to recognise when a customer is bidding for its attention,&apos; says De Ruiter. &apos;Thus, we have studied the process of ordering a drink in real life.&apos; The machine requires a clear-cut definition of which signals indicate an order and which do not. Without a proper definition, it will misinterpret its customers&apos; signals. In turn, it would annoy or discomfort people by responding inappropriately to their behaviour.
