Itâs, âCan you manage these egos, these personalities, without having one your damn self?â Heâs done it.â

Jeremy has become a storyteller, having been filled in over the years by local farmers and fishermen: legend has it that customs officers blew up one of the tunnels to catch tobacco smugglers in the 18th century, that there are gold deposits and jewellery buried around the coast, and even that the Sansoms&amp;rsquo; own house belonged to smugglers. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to know what&amp;rsquo;s true and what&amp;rsquo;s been accepted over time,&amp;rdquo; Jeremy says, laughing. &amp;ldquo;We hoped we&amp;rsquo;d find a secret tunnel from our house into the cliffs, but no luck.&amp;rdquo;

He spends more time on Amazonâs newer businesses, such as Amazon Web Services, the streaming video and music initiatives, and, in particular, the Kindle and Kindle Fire efforts. (Executives joke darkly that employees canât even pass gas in the Kindle buildings without the CEOâs permission.) But Bezos can always make his presence felt anywhere in the company.

Obama had the upper hand in this fight from the start. He has the Constitution on his side. Republicans single out the ACA as the centerpiece of the debt. Which is asinine as any current costs or increase of the debt by ACA is nominal. They didn&amp;#8217;t offer a bill with specific spending cuts. Their sole goal was to take away something that the President fought for. In other words&amp;#8230;Obama was right. Tea Publicans tried to hold the country and the Constitution hostage over ideological disagreements. The President didn&amp;#8217;t ask Republicans for concessions to sign a debt deal. The Republicans did. And they are deservingly taking a beating for it. However, there is a spending problem in this country. The right thing to do is to take this fight to the budget process. The left and the right need to find common ground to reduce government expenditures.
