They&apos;re a wonderful match and Olivia is a wonderful woman and Olivia is great for the administration. That truth is what keeps Mellie in the ring because she has to keep finding the compromise. She knows that Olivia isn&apos;t evil and isn&apos;t the enemy, and that is sort of the worst scenario of all.

Saudi has had bad political relationships with many countries and still continued to deal with them commercially. This is just a political rift and doesn&apos;t mean that it will affect the private or public businesses,&quot; said a Saudi official.
