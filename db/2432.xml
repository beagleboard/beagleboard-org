    <body>Can I use your phone? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/stmap_bd820.html?cipralex.amaryl.sporanox.cialis&quot;&gt;can you take ibuprofen with apo-naproxen&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;Political correctness&amp;rdquo;, in other words, is a phrase with very particular historical origins and significance. Unfortunately, it has been debauched by over-use to the point where it is almost meaningless &amp;ndash; and it is to David Cameron&amp;rsquo;s credit that he said as much during his leadership campaign in 2005. It is not &amp;ldquo;politically correct&amp;rdquo; to stop children calling each other &amp;ldquo;spastic&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;gay&amp;rdquo; in the playground. It is not &amp;ldquo;politically correct&amp;rdquo; for schools and employers to offer (for instance) practising Muslims the opportunity to pray and, where possible, halal food. It is not &amp;ldquo;politically correct&amp;rdquo; to say that Little Black Sambo, published in 1899, is no longer an appropriate book for the classroom.
