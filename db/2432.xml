They&amp;rsquo;re always bad gigs. When you do an arena show it&amp;rsquo;s the Ideal Motorhome Exhibition on the Monday, then it&amp;rsquo;s the world suitcase collection or whatever on Friday. They&amp;rsquo;re acoustically compromised spaces. I can&amp;rsquo;t see that people are having a meaningful experience there. It has not been a fruitful area of experiment has it?&amp;rdquo;
