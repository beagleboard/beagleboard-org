 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/generic-pharma-sa-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;universal pharmacy discount inc&lt;/a&gt;  Sunora has only a few dozen employees and an overhead befitting its warehouse location. Still, itâs abuzz with ideas to tap into the changes detailed in the EEI report. Its engineers have come up with solar canopies that can be installed in supermarket and department store parking lots or above drive-up ATMs. They provide shade and generate clean power that can be used by the buyer or sold back to the grid. Sunora says it has pitched a mass purchase of canopies to a large U.S. retailer for its parking lots, though it wonât name the company. For customers who think the canopies are too industrial-looking, Sunora developed a decorative solar pergolaâa kind of standalone patioâthat provides the output of a rooftop system without cluttering the roof with solar panels. It can be installed in two days. Crane says he can sell lots of them to luxury hotels, though he hasnât yet. Sunora is also working with DEKA, a Manchester (N.H.) technology-development company, on a microgrid package for homeowners. The price isnât set yet, but Sunora executives say they hope to start selling a 10-kilowatt residential system for about $20,000 in 2015.
