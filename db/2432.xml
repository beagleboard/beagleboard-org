He probably would have had a third RBI on the play had the runner been anyone but Alex Rodriguez, he of the bad hips and aching left hamstring. A-Rod stopped at third, and he and Cano were stranded when Alfonso Soriano grounded out. Kuroda came out after allowing a leadoff single to left by Victorino in the seventh. It was a hard grounder past Eduardo Nunez at third. Asked if Nunez shouldâve made the play, Girardi said, âItâs a tough play. Itâs a play he can make, but itâs a tough play.â
