It is nearly identical to RomneyCare with changes only where necessary to accommodate national aspects rather than a single state aspect. RomneyCare was based on the bi-partisan republican and democratic insurance plan alternative to Clinton&apos;s offered in the 90&apos;s and almost passed. The individual mandate came from the conservative think tank, Heritage Foundation. Both ObamaCare and RomneyCare are hybrids of that 1990&apos;s bi-partisan plan. Pretty pathetic that the GOP now hates what it once supported just because Barack Obama is president (and it isn&apos;t just health care the GOPTPers have done flip flops about).
