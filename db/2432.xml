Or maybe, could I use the Low Balance Alert to let me know when the balance on my checking account went below zero? Again, sadly, the answer was no. While the balance on my account did briefly dip below zero intraday, it was nice and positive &amp;#8212; to the tune of $87.44 &amp;#8212; by the end of the day, so the Low Balance Alert, which looks only at the end-of-day balance, would never have been triggered. And naturally, while it&amp;#8217;s possible to get activity alerts for my checking account and for my credit card account, it&amp;#8217;s weirdly impossible to get any kind of activity alert whatsoever for the overdraft loan facility.
