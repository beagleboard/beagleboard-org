The Donald&apos;s oldest daughter Ivanka and her hubby Jared Kushner spared no expense when she wed the budding real estate mogul at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ on Oct. 25, 2009. Donning a Vera Wang gown designed to resemble Grace Kelly&apos;s, Trump - who converted to her husband&apos;s Jewish faith - said their vows beneath a massive huppah, or wedding canopy, in front of 500 guests.
