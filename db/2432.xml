    <body>Some First Class stamps &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/our-pharmacy-storecom-5884.pdf&quot;&gt;our-pharmacy-store.com review&lt;/a&gt;  I wanted to meet the more challenging students &amp;ndash; those less constrained to speak, the ones who will be featured in Educating Yorkshire, those among the 10 per cent who take up 90 per cent of teachers&amp;rsquo; time. Tom is 15. In Educating Yorkshire we see him being variously cheeky, insulting and disruptive. He is a handful for his teachers, who have tried everything from detention to isolation to exclusion in the attempt to persuade him to change his behaviour. When I met him I knew his history, but as a light-hearted icebreaker I asked if he considered himself a swot. &amp;lsquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a swot?&amp;rsquo; he said. I asked why he kept getting into trouble. &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m short-tempered so I kick off,&amp;rsquo; he said, staring at his battered shoes and rarely meeting my gaze. &amp;lsquo;I used to be in detention every day, I had to go to the gym and copy lines out for an hour, but I used to just go to sleep. Or draw.&amp;rsquo; That makes Tom sound like a lazy deadbeat, but there is an endearing fragility about him. He didn&amp;rsquo;t seem a lost cause, he just needed to be handled the right way and he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been given many breaks in life. Tom lives in Thornhill. &amp;lsquo;This is a proper racist area,&amp;rsquo; he said and he should know: his brother went to prison for his part in a racist attack. &amp;lsquo;He didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything &amp;ndash; he was just there when it happened,&amp;rsquo; Tom claimed. And what happened? I asked. &amp;lsquo;One of his mates stabbed an Asian across the face, a big scar down there,&amp;rsquo; he said, pointing at his cheek. &amp;lsquo;My brother got 15 months, but he only did five plus tag. He&amp;rsquo;s 19.&amp;rsquo;

Gains have come fromimproving economic data, anticipation of a better-than-expectedearnings season and reduced concern about cuts to the Fed&apos;s $85billion in monthly bond purchases.
