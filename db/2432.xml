Poyet seems a much better man manager, was adored by the Brighton fans, made some great signings and played some lovely football in the Championship, which isn&apos;t easy to do.

So for him to come over there was great. We&apos;re going to feed off each other this whole entire year and we&apos;re going to need each other. So as long as we still have each other&apos;s back, I feel that we&apos;re going to be a very tough running back corps.&quot;
