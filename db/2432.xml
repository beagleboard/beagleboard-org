But earlier this week, they told my office that they have yet to receive any donations specifically made to pay for Petraeusâ salary.

The Aristocats and Ratatouille show that an animated Paris populated by talking animals can be even more romantic as the live action version (and you don&apos;t have to put up with Meg Ryan having a lactose intolerant episode after eating lots of cheese, which happens in French Kiss), while the absurdly warm-hued Montmartre of Jean-Pierre Jeunet&apos;s Amélie, stuffed to the gills with classic Parisian types, proves the nostalgia isn&apos;t limited to American films and can also be home-grown.
