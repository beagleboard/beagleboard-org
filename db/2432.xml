    <body>I like watching football &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.layeredonline.com/wwwhealthstreamcomhlchcalogin-dd54.pdf#gooseberry&quot;&gt;healthstream.com/hlc/brookdale&lt;/a&gt;  Staples was the youngest member of The Staples Singers, led by her father Roebuck &amp;lsquo;Pops&amp;rsquo; Staples, a gospel folk quartet whose songs became an integral part of the American civil rights movement in the Sixties. A stop start solo career saw Mavis working with Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper and Prince over the next three decades in mainstream soul and R&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;B but it is her 21st century work in rootsy Americana with sympathetic producers that has really solidified her reputation as one of the true greats. You Are Not Alone, her 2010 collaboration with Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, won Staples her first Grammy. The follow up is even better.
