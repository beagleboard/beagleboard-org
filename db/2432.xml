Her traditional-seeming stories are anything but. She&amp;rsquo;ll shift multiple points of view or time schemes &amp;mdash; hair-raisingly complicated stuff &amp;mdash; not to show off formally but to find a means of packing her stories with maximum density. She&amp;rsquo;s the most savage writer I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read, also the most tender, the most honest, the most perceptive. This is one of those years where no one can complain about the Nobel Committee&amp;rsquo;s choice. I&amp;rsquo;m so incredibly happy that she won.
