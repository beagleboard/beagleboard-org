    <body>I like watching TV &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/stmap_22060.html?levitra.cefuroxime.dinitrate&quot;&gt;lamisil recepta&lt;/a&gt;  Think of three people. Anna, who was being paid a salary of $60,000, is told that this year she will be paid only $57,000 &amp;#8212; she&amp;#8217;s being given a $3,000 pay cut. She gets very angry. Betty, in the country next door, was also being paid a salary of $60,000, and gets no pay rise, despite the fact that there&amp;#8217;s 5% inflation. She&amp;#8217;s not happy, but she&amp;#8217;s not as angry as Anna. Finally there&amp;#8217;s Carly, who is being paid a salary of $50,000, and who got a $10,000 bonus last year; this year, she&amp;#8217;s told, she&amp;#8217;ll get a $7,000 bonus. She&amp;#8217;s pretty happy.
