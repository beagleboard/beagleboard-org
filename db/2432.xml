    <body>I do some voluntary work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/stmap_bd820.html?lukol.levitra.serevent.trimox&quot;&gt;can you take ibuprofen with apo-naproxen&lt;/a&gt;  It will be about time. I am a middle aged mother (51) who had cancer in my FEET, yes that&apos;s right my feet both.  The bones in my feet had to be broken to get at the cancer and never healed properly due to the brittle bone disease I have.   Nothing can be done to cure this.   When I walk it is A G O N Y no other word can describe pain.   I have tried every known available painkiller even those with side effects.   My life was shit, vomiting, diaahorea, headaches, trembling, flushes, I could go on.   I thought I can&apos;t live like this so I was put on anti-depression tablets which only made me more suicidal.   What saved me was WEED, a friend suggested I try it and at first I was no way, I will become addicted to it.  What an ass I was I should have tried it years ago.  I am off all tablets, can walk short distances but getting better, my whole quality of life has improved both for my husband and family.   How have I achieved this ????? I smoke ONE cigarette with some weed in it a DAY that&apos;s it.  My tablets which I had to take every month cost me &amp;euro;132 but not anymore. I pay &amp;euro;15 for 7 cigarettes with weed in them to my best friend every week.   Am I addicted??? No as sometimes my friend can&apos;t get weed for weeks and I have to return to the dreaded painkillers.  Weed is a plant, it is not mixed with anything, its natural so why can&apos;t I get it on prescription?
