    <body>I wanted to live abroad &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/stmap_e52c0.html?tenormin.levitra.aventyl&quot;&gt;immuno sciroppo pharmalife&lt;/a&gt;  This report is going to have no visible effect on Fed policy. The Fed has no employment-growth target: the thing it cares about, on the jobs front, is unemployment. So when it comes to measures like tapering and rate hikes, the survey which matters most is the household survey &amp;#8212; the employment status of American households &amp;#8212; rather than the establishment survey, which measures the size of total US payrolls. Theoretically, the two surveys are two different ways of measuring the same thing, but in practice we&amp;#8217;re seeing in the jobs report exactly the same thing that we&amp;#8217;ve been seeing for most of the recovery: businesses reporting healthy numbers, with workers in general, and people looking for work in particular, seeing little benefit as a result.
