But if Republicans demand that the president defund, delay or repeal his main domestic-policy accomplishment, the president says no (&quot;This is a red line that I will not cross, and let me be clear, this red line is actually red and a line.&quot;) and the government shuts down, moderate voters are likely to think: &quot;Well, that&apos;s a bit uncalled for.
