It&apos;s where Max (Matt Damon) dreams of escaping since his childhood in an orphanage, portrayed in a series of over-stylized and over-sentimental flashbacks. But he&apos;s stuck in Los Angeles, which by 2154 has devolved into a favela-town policed by robot cops, sweat shop bullies and street gangs. A workplace accident gives his life a very short expiration date and Max&apos;s only chance for survival is to finally make good on his dream to go to Elysium, where the health care borders on miraculous. With an old buddy (Diego Luna), Max reaches out to Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime boss who runs a cartel that smuggles &quot;illegals&quot; (as the poor earthlings are called by Elysium&apos;s residents) to the luxury space craft. But in exchange for a ride, Max must steal &quot;brain data&quot; &amp;ndash; invaluable information that could include bank PINs, company codes and the like &amp;ndash; from a billionaire corporate titan (William Fichtner), by downloading them to his own mind.
