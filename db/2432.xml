First, the middle and high school girls meet one another at an upstate New York camp, where obstacle courses in groups help build teamwork and represent hurdles theyâll face in the real world. Then they travel to Barnard College for workshops about all things business â from market research and customer analysis to financing start-ups. The week ends with a âPitchfest,â where girls will present their business plans to a panel of angel investors and local businesswomen, including Dede Lahman, co-owner of the lower East Sideâs Clinton Street Baking Co. and jewelry designer Alex Woo.
