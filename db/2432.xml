Families and taxpayers canât just keep paying more and more into an undisciplined system; weâve got to get more out of what we pay for. Some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. Some states are testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how well they do.

Not in the long run. As temperatures rise, the costs will rise and the benefits decline &amp;ndash; and the balance will tip sooner in some places than others. From 2070, global warming will become a net cost to the world, justifying cost-effective climate action now and in the decades to come.

And while workers might eventually get paid for the days they missed, the damage would be done for local restaurants.
