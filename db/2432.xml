It is the most important thing of all, an expression of what we do with the talents and values and empathies given to use by our Creator and by those who raise and mentor us.

They accept no responsibility for their own actions and failures and seek to place the blame elsewhere, most often on those who by matters of birth, luck, and hard work have managed to achieve material success even if they too may lack emotional security.

He uses the money to keep the dictatorship flush with funds, so it&amp;#39;s hugely problematic.&quot;â¨â¨

But as we all know, there is far more to news than that. Indeed, it&amp;rsquo;s often the wacky, weird, offbeat and sometimes off-color stories that can most intrigue and fascinate us.
