The Cubs would likely pick up a majority of the $24 million still owed to Soriano through next season, with most of it going toward his $18 million salary for 2014. The Yankees took the same approach in acquiring Wells from the Angels during spring training, helping them in their quest to remain beneath the $189 million luxury-tax threshold in 2014.
