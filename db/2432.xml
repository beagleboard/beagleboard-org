Gentry said he hunted for years with both men, as well as the owner of the cabin, Gilliland&amp;#39;s brother, Bill, the owner of a gas station and tire store on the coast. Gentry said he did not know the boy.

At the time, elliptic curves were in vogue and hash-based RNG was under scrutiny. The hope was that elliptic curve techniquesâbased as they are on number theoryâwould not suffer many of the same weaknesses as other techniques (like the FIPS 186 SHA-1 generator) that were seen as negative, and Dual_EC_DRBG was an accepted and publicly scrutinized standard. SP800-90 (which defines Dual EC DRBG) requires new features like continuous testing of the output, mandatory re-seeding, optional prediction resistance and the ability to configure for different strengths.
