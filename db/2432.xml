A much larger spike in radioactive cesium in early July in a different well eventually led to Tepco overturning months of denials and admitting that radioactive water had been leaking into the sea.

Ryan McDonagh inked a big contract extension in the offseason and will play alongside Dan Girardi again on the top pair. A healthy Marc Staal , who was the Rangersâ best player in the preseason, will start next to Michael Del Zotto , who could have a breakout year under a new coaching staff that encourages loads of offense from its defensemen. John Moore and Anton Stralman complete the group on a third pairing that can skate and contribute offensively. The only question mark is the Rangersâ depth after that: Vigneault chose his words carefully when he said seventh defenseman Justin Falk played âall rightâ in the preseason. Look for Conor Allen , 23, signed last spring as an undrafted free agent, to make a run at Falkâs spot later this season.

To say he was a great writer of crime fiction is insanely limiting, and insulting to his talent and work. He was simply a great writer of fiction. He created a world as vivid and memorable as Hemingway&apos;s, or Faulkner&apos;s, or Fitzgerald&apos;s. He did this over more than 40 novels. They still ought to give him the Nobel Prize for literature.
