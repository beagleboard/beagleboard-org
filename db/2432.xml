    <body>I live in London &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/naturya-organic-maca-powder-packet-300g-79a8.pdf#disappearance&quot;&gt;naturya natural chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;It is a crime to be born a woman in India&amp;rdquo; are words that now hang over the country. What other words would you use? In April this year, another child, a five-year-old girl from the slums of new Delhi, was kidnapped, raped and tortured by two men. The police refused to search the building she was left to die in. When she was finally found, the child had been so badly sexually mutilated, she needed an immediate colostomy. She defied expectation and survived. However, the family of the child, known only as Gudiya &amp;ndash; or &amp;lsquo;little doll,&amp;rsquo; were offered a bribe of Rs 2,000 to stop bothering the police.
