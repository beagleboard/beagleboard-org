    <body>How much will it cost to send this letter to ? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlam.com/index.php/stmap_77410.html?chlorzoxazone.acivir.cialis&quot;&gt;bluefusion bluetooth toyota&lt;/a&gt;  The bottom line: Not everything in life needs to come down to stats. People have a variety of reasons for being in hedge funds, from the way it makes them feel to the way it differentiates their portfolios - all of them valid on either a financial level or an emotional level or both. That $2 trillion in hedge fund AUM is not going to shrink in the future, it is going to grow. This is because there will always be new superstars with new ways of investing and generating returns. And the best of these managers will frequently opt for the wrapper in which they&apos;re paid the most for their efforts.Â It&apos;s hard to beat the management-plus-incentive structure.
