The intent was to make everyone onboard comfortable, including the unrelated 12-year-old sitting in the same row.&quot;

Considered as exploration, most of the activity will occur in Earth&apos;s deep oceans, and it may be that historians will consider the cumulative adventures of the submersible Alvin as the most representative emblem of the era. But the story of Alvin is a biography rather than the narrative of a quest. What the age begs for is the equivalent of a circumnavigation of the world-circling oceanic abyss or a traverse of the solar system, an expedition outfitted not just to adventure and survive but to inquire beyond the realm of the possible. Which is why my vote goes to Voyager. More munificently than any other mission Voyager speaks to what exploration means in our times, and why it matters, and how we might understand our age&apos;s awkward alloy of innovation and historical inheritance. It triangulates our place in the unfolding trajectory and &quot;new regions&quot; of the third age. And now Voyager 1 has trekked beyond the heliosphere.
