Itâs not going to happen often, those two days, so itâs something I want to remember because Iâve played for like 13 years, and I donât remember too many of those days.â

I&apos;ve been saying that since day one, he&apos;s almost like a big brother figure in our lives. Just really motivates us and tells us things that the average teammate or the average older brother probably wouldn&apos;t tell us. He cares about us and he sees the future bright in our careers here in Philadelphia and things like that. With him having a year left on his contract, a year left on his deal, he kind of always stresses that, you know, &apos;I&apos;m going to do what I can on this last year and see what happens.&apos; I think he&apos;s going to give it a great shot. He wants everybody to know that he can still play this game at a high level.
