    <body>perfect design thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/derivehealthcarecom-83f5.pdf&quot;&gt;tabletspill.no&lt;/a&gt;  Economic growth rates must take population growth into account: for an economy to grow in a meaningful sense, it must cover the growth of its population. With populations in African countries often growing at more than one-and-a-half percent per year, one-and-a-half percent of economic growth goes merely to keep the population at existing levels of average income. This means that the headline projected figure of eight percent growth for the whole continent could in fact equal less than six-and-a-half percent. This may still sound encouraging, but if growth drops to the same level as in the developed countries, it will hardly be growth at all.

That is still not far from the 28 percent hit in June, which is the highest rate among the 17 countries that use the euro currency.
