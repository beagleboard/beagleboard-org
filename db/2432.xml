Michael Keaton does a pyrotechnic mad man surprisingly well. Liev Schreiber, a usually very serious actor, is hilarious as a Chechen black market explosives dealer. The gorgeous Eva Mendes is completely believable as formerly obese women only beginning to realize her newly-gained good looks. Even Kate Hudson, as Nathan&apos;s love interest, is game to play the straight man against David&apos;s antics.
