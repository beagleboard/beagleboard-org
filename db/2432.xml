Fifty-one per cent of donât knows said they would want Holyrood to become primarily responsible for welfare and taxation, compared with just 13 per cent who backed no further change. So a clear package of further devolution might persuade some ditherers to vote No. Equally, the reception given to this autumnâs government white paper on independence might be a factor in either easing their concerns about independence, or reaffirming their doubts.
