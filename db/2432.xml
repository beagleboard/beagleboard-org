The XB1 has a new mode that will allow you to watch TV while you wait for a match to load and then itâll notify you when itâs ready. You can then quickly switch back to your game. This isnât something that I think will be used for some of your more popular games; however, if youâre playing an older game or a map that might not be as popular, itâs a feature thatâs really cool. So lets say that youâre waiting for your match to load. I loved a game on my PS3 called Starhawk where sometimes it would take 30 minutes for a specific map to have enough people to load. With this feature, I could watch TV and wait for my map to load; however, what if I was watching something pretty cool and then was notified that my match had loaded? I could snap the TV to have it playing in the background and play my game. In the end, itâs a neat feature.
