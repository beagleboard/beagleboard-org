He hit his first homer of the year on Saturday and then he had four hits, with another home run, on Sunday, as his average climbed to .266. &quot;This is what we envisioned coming out of spring training,&quot; Span said after the team had 18 hits in the 14-1 win. Span had three RBIs. Said manager Davey Johnson: &quot;He is swinging the bat a lot better. I like his approach.&quot;
