    <body>I&apos;m interested in  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?topamax.manforce.viagra.reglan&quot;&gt;cialis everyday side effects&lt;/a&gt;  We all know those blokes &amp;ndash; the ones who treat the opposite sex appallingly &amp;ndash; always have several women on the go, are unclear about their intentions and cheat at the drop of the hat. So why are we (or more specifically me) friends with them? Aren&amp;rsquo;t I being a bad feminist by - while not actively encouraging my friend&amp;rsquo;s frankly misogynistic behaviour &amp;ndash; condoning it through my silence? Because although I roll my eyes and tut a bit as they leave broken hearts in their wake, for the most part I do stay silent. Partly because I hate arguing with people, and partly because I like my friends, and I can&amp;rsquo;t reconcile their bad behaviour towards (other) women with their (generally good) behaviour towards me. Maybe I need to speak up a bit more.
