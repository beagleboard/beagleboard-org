    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/testosterone-nation-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;testosterone fda approved legend drug&lt;/a&gt;  Backman was suspended for two games â he actually served his ban on Thursday and Friday, getting a jump on things before the penalties were officially handed down on Friday â while Valdespin and Rodriguez each were hit with three-game bans. Valdespin is suspended through Las Vegasâ game on Sunday while Rodriguez will serve his suspension with Double-A Binghamton since he was demoted this week. The suspensions and details of the incident were reported by Mets Blog on SNYâs website.
