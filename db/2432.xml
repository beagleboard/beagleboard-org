Even more troubling, if these hypothetical investors withdrew 5 percent of their portfolios in the first year, and increased withdrawals each year to keep pace with inflation, within 18 years the portfolios were wiped out, decimated by poor returns from stocks and bonds.

The paper was to be submitted by a fake African researcher, and when his reviewers said the English might be a little too good to plausibly have come from a non-native English speaker, he used Google to translate his work into French and then back into English.
