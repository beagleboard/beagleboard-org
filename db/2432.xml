    <body>We need someone with experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://accentresurfacing.com/idlife-shakes-4110.pdf#bent&quot;&gt;idlife new products&lt;/a&gt;  Compared to animal bones, plant matter (including seeds) donât usually last too long in archaeological samples. In order to identify the seeds of the garlic mustard plant (Alliaria petiolata) in the samples they took, the scientists looked for microscopic traces of plant-based silica known as phytoliths, which tend to last longer than the plant cells themselves. They compared their findings to the phytolith records of 120 different species and were able to identify them as garlic mustard. As the garlic mustard plant has basically no nutritional value, researchers concluded it must have been included to add taste to the food. The ancient food remnants contained no whole garlic mustard seeds, and by recreating the ancient recipe, they found that crushing the seeds of the plant releases their flavor.
