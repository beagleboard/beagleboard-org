    <body>Looking for work &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?levitra.antivert.cystone.asacol&quot;&gt;go-gx.com&lt;/a&gt;  In recent days, as A-Rod has looked woefully out of sync at the bat â he got his second hit in six games and an RBI Wednesday â and somewhat less than gazelle-like on the basepaths and in the field, he has put out caution signs that recovery from the sort of hip injury heâs attempting to come back from âis a processâ and could take some time. He has until July 22 on this rehab assignment to prove to the Yankees heâs ready to be placed on the major league roster. If not, he goes back on the disabled list and, presumably, back to batting, baserunning and fielding drills in Tampa, along with further evaluation from the doctors.
