    <body>What&apos;s the last date I can post this to  to arrive in time for Christmas? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/rx-human-papillomavirus-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;rx human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;This is a welcome development, but both sides of the investigation are at relatively early stages, with much work remaining to be done,&quot; Scotland Yard said in a statement about its own case and the Portuguese announcement. &quot;This new momentum is encouraging, but we still have a way to go, and as with all major investigations, not all lines of enquiry that look promising will yield results.&quot;

Aren&amp;rsquo;t we the experts? Apparently not. &apos;&apos;That&amp;rsquo;s really dangerous, Mum,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; my daughter told me when I suggested her firstborn might sleep better on her front. She was right.

Hard indeed!
