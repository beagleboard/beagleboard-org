It goes back to if there is a good reason for you to be on that statin, it outweighs the risk of a mild increase in risk of cataract,&quot; Cioffi, who was not involved in the new study, said.

He added: &amp;ldquo;We have to think through strategically what&amp;rsquo;s going to be in our long-term national interests.&amp;rdquo;
