Earlier in the year HP discussed plans to release an AMD-based cartridge with integrated APUs (accelerated processing units) focused on gaming and video transcoding, as well as a quad-processor cartridge using a 32-bit ARM Cortex A9-based Calxeda SoC that can scale up to 1,800 server nodes per rack.

It seems to me that Obama is all show. First of all Obama should stay out of Russian politics. They don&amp;#8217;t want western morals contaminating their country. And I can&amp;#8217;t blame them. We are the most hated country in the world, and for good reason. And as far as accepting gays life style, I would say that main stream America does not. Obama doesn&amp;#8217;t speak for us. His proclamation calling the month of June gay lesbian etc. is a joke. It&amp;#8217;s more like a zoo than any thing else.
