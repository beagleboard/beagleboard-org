    <body>I work for myself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/nutritiendacom-opiniones-6865.pdf&quot;&gt;nutritienda.com.pt&lt;/a&gt;  Klaus Regling: Out of the overall Greek programme, 50 billion euro has gone via the Greek government to the Greek banks and that has restructured and recapitalized the four largest Greek banks. What you are maybe alluding to and what we are not able to do this year is direct bank re-capitalisation, which maybe we will be allowed to do next year. This instrument might be created once the European Central Bank acts as a common supervisor in the euro-area, then this possibility might exist. At the moment we have to do it indirectly, money goes to the government, earmarked for the banks, that has happened.
