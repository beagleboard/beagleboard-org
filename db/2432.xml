Rouhani, whose presidency began less than 2 months ago in August, made his first appearance at the United Nations and garnered a great deal of attention from the United States media, first when he declined to meet President Obama, then when he appeared to condemn the Holocaust in an interview on CNN- although a later clarification of his comments from the Iranian media showed his comments on the topic to be a bit vaguer than originally reported- and finally, when Obama confirmed that the two men spoke on the phone. Nevertheless, Rouhani&amp;#8217;s visit generally continued to promote a sense of optimism about the new leader and a possibility of improved relations between the United States and Iran. Here are five hopeful signs of such an improvement.
