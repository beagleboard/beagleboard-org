Every six months, a new layer, or âlamina,â is deposited. The laminae have regular color differences due to annual feeding and migration patterns, allowing researchers to distinguish each and every six-month period in the whalesâ lives. Since whales donât clean their ears like we do, their entire history is recorded in the wax plug by the time they die. These earplugs have long been used by scientists to figure out the age of whales, but it turns out the wax can tell us much more about whalesâ lives than just how old they are.
