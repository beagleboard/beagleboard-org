Whispers was closed for a week, and Heartbreakers for a month. Around the same time, the sheriff came by to warn managers that they needed to make sure dancers weren&amp;#8217;t making contact with customers. Unconfirmed gossip was that Whispers hadn&amp;#8217;t racked up nearly as many violations as Heartbreakers, but the city felt they would be accused of favoritism if both weren&amp;#8217;t cited. They are enforcing strict no-touching rules now. Perhaps the cycle has sped up or maybe this is a temporary glitch, but I&amp;#8217;ve never seen so much attention paid to the clubs.

But part of that ... we also have to confirm or disprove the circumstances,&quot; Gorniak told WKYC. &quot;If the circumstances say this is what happened, well, the scene, does that match? And we have to say yay or nay. That&apos;s why the investigator goes back and takes their pictures and looks around and brings that information back to, not just myself, but to the pathologist who is doing the autopsy, if it correlates to what we&apos;re seeing on the body.&quot;

But are they truly healthier?
