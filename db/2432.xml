Workers can&amp;rsquo;t permanently keep their retirement benefits until they are vested in the plan. Vesting schedules for 401(k)s generally range from immediate vesting to requirements of five or six years of service before you can keep employer contributions if you leave the firm. Only 43 percent of workers were vested in their retirement benefits in 2012, EBRI found. Those who aren&amp;rsquo;t fully vested could lose part or all of their employer contributions to retirement benefits if they lose or leave their current job.
