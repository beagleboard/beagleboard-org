    <body>Would you like to leave a message? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplecreativedesign.co.uk/stmap_58840.html?viagra.breast.tetracycline.duralast&quot;&gt;www.netcaremedicalscheme.co.za&lt;/a&gt;  Disney star Corbin Bleu and Karina have a Viennese waltz. Nerd alert! Corbin learns the âGame of Thronesâ theme is their song and He. Geeks. Out. Does their routine start off with CGI dragons? Check. Is he loaded with guyliner? Check. Is that a furry loincloth? Check. This routine is otherworldly. I mean, this dance is literally from a different world, so I donât know how to critique it. Except it looks good. And did they raid Cherâs closet for their wardrobe? Both of them? Likely check. Bruno says the Viennese waltz require flowing lines, but they lost the flow. Carrie Ann thinks it successfully sold a passionate story. Len says it lacks proper ballroom hold. Score: 23. Consolation prize: Corbin can keep the prop throne.
