He awakens her carnal desires, and, realizing what sheâs been missing, she guzzles a bottle of alcohol. A few hours and one drunken hookup with Rusty later (alas, he thinks sheâs someone else), sheâs on a mission: to catch up on all the hanky-panky, beer and filthy language she missed out on before starting college.

I&apos;ve been down south and seen how they treat certain groups of people. I have no great love for the south. I don&apos;t think they&apos;ve ever come together after the Civil War.&quot;
