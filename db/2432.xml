    <body>We were at school together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/healthonwheelsyoocoorg-a6a4.pdf&quot;&gt;zonehealthandfitness.com&lt;/a&gt;  Kershaw (11-7) allowed two runs â one earned â and struck out eight to help the Dodgers complete their seventh series sweep of the season. Tampa Bay&apos;s only hits off the left-hander through the first seven innings came in the fifth, a leadoff single by Yunel Escobar and a two-out triple by pinch-hitter Sam Fuld.

The budding model showed off photos of herself in swimsuits posing for Agua Bendita Swimwear. Good PR, Kendall!

Seven years later, the house went Technicolor with an even more garish shade.
