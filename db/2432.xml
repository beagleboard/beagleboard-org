Tory party members tend to have old-fashioned views. Before she was put on the A-list, Ms Leadsom was interviewed for a ticket in 17 constituencies, and lost out to a man every time. That might sound like an argument for more women-boosting measures. Yet under pressure from irate functionaries the Tories have scrapped the A-list. Party bosses claim that the number of Conservative women MPs will nonetheless riseâbecause the success of the 2010ers will persuade more able women to come forward as candidates and more party associations to pick them. The candidacies of four Tory seats now up for consideration, including Croydon South and Newark, will be an important test of that.
