His father trained decathletes and his mother was a contemporary dance teacher. The youngest of three sons, he spent part of his childhood in Dakar, Senegal, before joining the Conservatoire National de Lyon for three years at the age of 13.

Many of them donât have Social Security to fall back on because workers in some states, often police and firemen, donât pay payroll taxes and participate in the program. Their pension was presumed to provide adequate security. Blaming the financial industry instead of taking a hard look at what these plans really cost undermines the financial security of public workers. Because eventually some plans will run out of money and workers will face a poorer retirement.
