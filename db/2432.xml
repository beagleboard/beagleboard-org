On her adorable video, which got over a million hits on YouTube, Kate tells Askmen.com, &apos;I really didn&amp;#146;t know that it was going to be as big of a hit, but I think that&amp;#146;s why it was such a hit, because I had no intention of it going on the internet.

At just 2.3 mm long, it may be the smallest dung beetle in the Guiana Shield, and perhaps the second smallest of currently described species in South America. Itsâ antler-like antennae provide an acute sense of smell. Dung beetles play critical ecological roles that help support healthy ecosystems â by burying dung, they regulate parasites and disease, disperse seeds, and recycle nutrients to promote plant growth. Since dung beetle communities are tightly linked with the mammals which provide them with food, they are also commonly studied as indicators of hunting intensity and ecosystem health.

These claims imply that e-cigarettes are a safe alternative to smoking, even though the health effects of e-cigarettes have not been adequately studied. The lack of regulation puts the public at risk because users of e-cigarettes are inhaling unknown chemicals with unknown effects.
