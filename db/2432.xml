In November, though, astronomers analyzing data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot;&gt;NASA&apos;s Galileo spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; found evidence that suggests blocks of ice interact with water below the surface, which could mean that nutrients and energy are moving between the underground ocean and icy shell.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ig.utexas.edu/people/staff/britneys/&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot;&gt;Britney Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, the lead author of the study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7374/full/nature10608.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot;&gt;which appeared in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, said that the interaction &quot;could make Europa and its ocean more habitable for life.&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/17/europa-water-jupiter-moon-photo-video_n_1099463.html#s480278&amp;title=Europa&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot;&gt;Click here to read more&lt;/a&gt; about water on Europa.
