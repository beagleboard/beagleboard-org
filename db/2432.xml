It&apos;s fine if you think that, but then you have nothing else to say about the movie, period, because you don&apos;t know if Quentin insulted your ancestors or not. On the other hand, Louis Farrakhan, who these blackest of black people say speaks the truth and expresses the vitriol of the angry black man, can look at the movie and go, &quot;Goddamn, that&apos;s a great fucking movie. Quentin Tarantino told the truth.&quot; Dick Gregory&apos;s seen the movie 12 fucking times. I respect what they have to say more than anybody else, because they&apos;ve been through it. They walked the walk with Dr. King. Some of the bullshit criticisms about Django come from people who don&apos;t understand the genre and who didn&apos;t live through that era.
