    <body>I&apos;d like to send this to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jalapaoecolodge.com.br/index.php/stmap_7abb0.html?lukol.clomipramine.cialis&quot;&gt;rexavar symptoms&lt;/a&gt;  Bob Crow is the trade union leader which everyone loves to hate, for his knack of always knowing when to call for the most inappropriate strikes. Not only has he challenged the government over and over again, he also picks fights with Ed Miliband, becoming the first union leader to openly criticise him. In fact, after Miliband&amp;rsquo;s reorganising of the ties between Labour and the unions, Crow said he was looking to rally support for a &amp;ldquo;new party of labour&amp;rdquo; accusing Miliband of &amp;ldquo;dancing to the tune of Tony Blair&amp;rdquo;. Caricatured as a champagne socialist, he has a salary of over Â£100,000 yet still chooses to live in a council house.
