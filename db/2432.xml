He continued towards Mount Cheviot, skimming trees and houses, cattle and men in the fields and, as he recalled it later for Ilse, his wife, &amp;ldquo;literally climbed the slope a few metres above the ground&amp;rdquo;. At the top he altered course a few degrees right to 280° and scorched onwards, still so low that by his own account he waved at people in the fields, towards his next point of aim, a small lake in the hills by the peak of Broad Law; here he made another slight alteration to take him over the Duke of Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s seat, Dungavel House.

Snowden publicly argued that he never intended to damage America and that he&apos;s already given all the information he has to give to various journalists â essentially, he has nothing left to leak. The reports based on his information, however, are not expected to stop, according to The Guardian columnist Glenn Greenwald, who told ABC News he&apos;s not even half done writing about what he&apos;s learned from Snowden.
