    <body>We&apos;d like to offer you the job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/focus-factor-walmart-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;focus factor reviews consumer reports&lt;/a&gt;  Amid the fights, tears and drunken rants on this season&apos;s &apos;Jersey Shore,&apos; the one thing that seems to stand out the most is J-Woww&apos;s ever-changing face. Following the fourth season premiere of the hit MTV reality show, a number of viewers were shocked by the buxom brunette&apos;s dramatic weight loss and gaunt face. With her plumper lips and tighter skin being the subject of speculation in recent weeks, J-Woww has finally broken her silence to reveal a rather surprising claim: She hasn&apos;t had any additional plastic surgery. &apos;If I got work done, I would be open to talking about it,&apos; she tells In Touch.&apos;[But] I didn&apos;t.&apos;
