Every single one of those roughly 9,000 medical services and procedures has its own five-digit code, known as current procedural terminology (CPT), and the AMA owns them all. That means that anyone&amp;#8212;physicians, labs, hospitals, you name it&amp;#8212;who wants to bill Medicare, Medicaid, or a private insurance company has to purchase either AMA books and products, or products from other software companies that pay AMA royalties and licensing fees to use the CPT codes. According to its annual report, in 2012 the AMA made $83.1 million in &amp;#8220;royalties and credentialing products,&amp;#8221; a large chunk of which comes from licensing CPT. Again: cha-ching.
