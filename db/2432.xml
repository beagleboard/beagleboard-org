    <body>Thanks for calling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/nhanes-prescription-drugs-7684.pdf#comma&quot;&gt;cost of aids drugs in africa&lt;/a&gt;  And Don is coming dangerously close to losing his. He has been juggling his mistress, his second wife and his family for some time now (something suggested by Roger&apos;s orange-juggling trick at the beginning of the episode). But once Sally walked in on him and Sylvia, that all came crashing down. While everyone else thinks Don is a saint for what he did for the Rosens, Sally knows he is a sinner. Will the scorn of his daughter be enough for Don to change his ways? Judging by the way he was able to walk away from Sally&apos;s door once he knew she would not blow his cover, not likely.
