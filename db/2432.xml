    <body>I&apos;d like to change some money &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/bodypharmbiz-reviews-69bc.pdf#rising&quot;&gt;bodypharm.biz scam&lt;/a&gt;  It is no wonder that so many people in the united states are in debt up to their eyes! We are a monkey see, monkey do society. Citizens are following the government right off this new soon to be fiscal cliff. Need more money, raise the limit on your credit cards. Need more money, go to the bank and borrow. This is no way to live and this is what is going to cause the economy to collapse. If we can&amp;#8217;t cover our expenses at the moment right now, how are we going to cover them in 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? We aren&amp;#8217;t. The Federal government is going the way of the cities like Detroit and Stockton. Sooner or later, we will be cut off and we will begin defaulting on our debts. If people think that the last economic slow down was bad, wait until the federal government defaults and a whole lot more in the way of services comes to a screeching halt. Stop spending my generations money!
