    <body>What sort of work do you do? &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/eckerd-pharmacy-apollo-beach-ef2c.pdf&quot;&gt;eckerd pharmacy near me&lt;/a&gt;  I&amp;#039;m disturbed at how there is a violent sex offender on the loose but the article was so quick to point fingers Canada way instead of towards the guy himself.

How the hell did he manage to cross into US with that kind of a conviction?? I know people who had fraud charges that are not allowed into US but a guy like this can get over? I dont think it was a matter of just Canada dropping the ball. There should be better cooperation between countries with these sort of issues.
