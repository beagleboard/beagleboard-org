These included staff salary costs, staff redundancy and office and accommodation costs which contributed to the higher total in 2011-12.

I desperately wanted to find some evidence of the eternal nature of our souls. But even at the tender age of eight, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t seem that likely to me. And I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at self-deception &amp;ndash; If I really don&amp;rsquo;t believe in something, I can&amp;rsquo;t pretend otherwise. Even to myself.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/phizz-unit-origami-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;phizz&lt;/a&gt;  Levine&amp;#8217;s second hypothesis is related to the fact that bonds in general, and agency bonds in particular, are instruments which are marked to market daily &amp;#8212; while jumbo loans are long-term assets which can sit on a bank&amp;#8217;s balance sheet for decades, through many credit cycles. If a bank buys mortgage bonds, notes Levine, then it is obliged to mark them down, taking a hit to its P&amp;L, if and when mortgage rates rise. Actual mortgages, on the other hand, not being marked to market, never need to suffer such markdowns. And that makes them more attractive. Conforming mortgages will always end up being priced off the market, and during times when banks expect interest rates to rise, the market might well be quite expensive, compared to loans which are designed to be held to maturity.
