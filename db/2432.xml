If you&amp;#8217;re in the market for a new gadget to supplement that smart mobile experience, you might prefer to have something head-mounted, like Google Glass. Samsung&amp;#8217;s smartwatch seems to have borrowed from Google with its &amp;#8220;always available&amp;#8221; camera and voice function, although it&amp;#8217;s a tossup whether it&amp;#8217;s more awkward to take pictures from your watch or from your glasses.
