    <body>Where do you live? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?asendin.cialis.relafen&quot;&gt;zovirax reddit&lt;/a&gt;  But nothing stays the same for very long, nowadays. And no sooner has Netflix established itself in the UK (though there&amp;rsquo;s still a long, long way to go in terms of brand awareness) than along comes Spanish-based Wuaki.tv, with its permanently discounted package and the ability to buy new TV and film releases in one place. The advantage: sites that actually sell films and TV shows are allowed to showcase them by studios much sooner than those who offer rental-only opportunities, like Netflix (where new releases can take up to a year to appear). And though their fees are still diddly-squat compared to the established UK TV subscription services, Netflix charges £5.99 and LoveFilm&amp;rsquo;s £4.99 for unlimited streaming. On their site, Wuaki promise &amp;lsquo;50% off for life&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; bringing it down £2.99, and driving home the price differential.
