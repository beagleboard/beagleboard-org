Forrest Whitaker is a great actor and he has some really good scenes, as does his son, played by David Oyelowo, but these scenes feel almost out of place amid the broad, low brow, and fairly obvious tone of the rest of the film. And to top it off, the movie is twenty minutes too long, the result of which is that by the time a pivotal character dies, a scene that could have been a tear jerker had it not been broadcast from a mile away, my group was shifting in our seats and stifling laughs. âLee Danielâs The Butlerâ is a movie that you feel like you should see, and having seen it, should like it. âThis is important and demanding of your respect,â the film seems to say.

The best franchises in the NFL donât start throwing people overboard at the first sign of trouble.

In 2010, it blocked a $39 billion bid by BHP Billiton, the Anglo-Australian mining giant, to buy Potash Corp, on the grounds of the &quot;net benefit&quot; test.
