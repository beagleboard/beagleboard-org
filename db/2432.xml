NCLB was supposed to raise academic performance and reduce gaps in outcomes between communities, creating 100-percent proficiency in math and reading across the country by 2014. It didnât do any of that, but it did do pretty well for the testing industry. Before NCLB, only 19 states tested every child every year. Now all 50 states and the District of Columbia do. President Obamaâs âRace to the Topâ program further linked funding with standardized testing, including the use of this Common Core test to evaluate teachers. It will cost the states billions of dollars to fully implement Common Core.

It shows that Steve is getting things right. He&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic coach and what James has done shows the programme is going in the right direction. I have to take a lot of confidence from that.&amp;rdquo;

Some experts had warned that a rushed election might lead to challenges and further crises.
