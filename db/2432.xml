Naturally, we expected that there would be reduced attraction between our grooved surface and the sphere, regardless of the distance between them, because the top of the grooved surface presents less total surface area and less material. However, we knew the Casimir force&apos;s dependence on the surface shape is not that simple.&quot;

First, once markets realize the Fed has doubts about bond buying they may move too fast for comfort, driving up yields and hitting equities in a damaging way.

Regulation should always be carefully assessed before implementation, even if it can be shown that it could be helpful. This is because there are many unintended consequences that must be taken into consideration. But when there is so little evidence that a regulation would do any good at all, politicians should simply keep their hands off.
