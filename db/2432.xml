Remy was arraigned in Waltham District Court Wednesday on charges of slamming Jennifer Martelâs face into a mirror in their townhouse.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/irmadrigalpharmacom-9e88.pdf&quot;&gt;lifeandhealth.ml&lt;/a&gt;  In sum, the Supreme Court has advanced same-sex marriage in a gradualist manner that basically tracks public opinion, which is also moving in that direction, the relative popularity of DOMA itself notwithstanding. With same-sex marriages now set to resume in California, about 30 percent of Americans live in states where SSM is legal. Gay marriage isn&apos;t a change that&apos;s coming in the future, depending on how battles in the courts and at the ballot box turn out. It&apos;s a fait accompli. The bigger question isn&apos;t whether more states will recognize same-sex marriage&amp;mdash;let alone whether there&apos;s much possibility of rollback&amp;mdash;but on what the terms of victory of the SSM side is going to be consolidated. Conservatives have a different battle to fight, psychologically as well as legally, to preserve religious liberty and ensure that this revolution already made doesn&apos;t enter a more radical phase. High-strung right-wingers who say, for example,that the country might as well embrace polygamy if it&apos;s going to have same-sex marriage are not doing themselves any favors. More seriously, this would be a good time for conservatives to take supporters of SSM at their word and insist on stronger cultural as well as legal affirmations of monogamy for everyone.
