The Republicans work for the rich and Corporate America and have been on a campaign for years and years to transfer the wealth of the poor and middle class into the pockets of the rich and Corporate America. They try to strip if not eliminate every program that benefits the poor and the middle class (ex. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, consumer protections, etc.).
