Both deny the charges. They won a vote on the same ticket in March.

Health problems do develop for many women around the peri-menopausal time of their life, and the limited, less than thorough understanding around these health issues among doctors is alarming, to say the least.  Many of the so called &apos;helpful&apos; prescriptions end up causing terrible side effects, and I for one am sick of reading about how women do not have to put up with difficult symptoms, and how they should talk to their doctor to find a suitable medical approach, when the fact is that Irish doctors are, both, limited in their understanding of what can be happening in an individual woman&apos;s body at peri menopause/menopause, and limited in what thay have to prescribe; they are so far behind many American/British doctors who are leading the field in better understanding of what can happen to a woman going through &apos;the change&apos;, and in offering new approaches to management.  And for the record:  could the medical profession stop talking about peri/menopause in terms of night sweats and hot flushes as if that is the full understanding of symptoms experienced, because they are not. The research might state that these are the only &apos;factual&apos; symptoms associated with menopause, but, trust me, experientially, they are not. Maybe it&apos;s time we opened up the discussion of &apos;the change&apos; to include the &apos;lead up&apos; period to the actual menopause (when periods stop), and post menopause so that we women can get a more complete understanding of what is happening us as individuals, physically, psychologically, emotionally, in our/its totality so that we can be more pro-active in managing/understanding onset of heavy or irregular periods, anemia, fibroids, fibrocystic breasts, estrogen dominance versus progesterone deficency, and subsequent side effects/symptoms, headaches, depressed moods, lack of concentration/focus, exhaustion etc. etc. etc.
