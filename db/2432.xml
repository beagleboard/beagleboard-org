    <body>I can&apos;t get a signal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/aidwellpharmacom-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;goldenpharmaeg.com&lt;/a&gt;  I think I might have screamed out loud, I was so happy to be outside, though nobody could have heard me in all that noise: I might as well have been trying to scream over jet engines on the tarmac at LaGuardia during a thunderstorm. It sounded like every fire truck, every cop car, every ambulance and emergency vehicle in five boroughs plus Jersey was howling and caterwauling out on Fifth Avenue, a deliriously happy noise: like New Year&amp;rsquo;s and Christmas and Fourth of July fireworks rolled into one.
