Unemployment stands at 11 percent. Europe&apos;s car industry has long struggled from overcapacity at factories and uncompetitive wages and labor laws, and the region&apos;s economic crisis has compounded these problems, as consumers put off big-ticket purchases.

To say that Winder is a jokey writer would not begin to do him justice.

Pastirik is not charged with killing the pedestrian. Instead, he&apos;s accused of causing more than $1,000 in damage to the government-owned Toyota Land Cruiser he was driving.
