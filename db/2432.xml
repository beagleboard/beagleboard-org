    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;https://oporajeyo.com/coq10-supplement-dosage-bf45.pdf&quot;&gt;coq10 and statins 2015&lt;/a&gt;  Thoreau wrote long ago, &amp;#8220;Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.&amp;#8221; Today many men and women feel lost, desperate, and in dire need of a new kind of politics and living, and a song to sing. Maybe through following some tenets written in the woods long ago, and rediscovering our essential values and nature, we can write our own lyrics and find that song for our nation and ourselves. To find a new way, and as Thoreau wrote, &amp;#8220;Only the day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.&amp;#8221;
