Grinning and embracing Corcoran, Parcells said: âWeâre a long way from Haglerâs (the landmark Oradell bar and restaurant where Parcells hug out as a kid and later held court all through the â80s and â90s when he came home to coach the Giants). âI was telling Billy here about the Park Ridge game . . . ,â Corcoran said.

That means Swedish classes, violin and piano lessons, karate, basketball and soccer practice. âItâs not safe for kids to play in the street anymore,â says the Nysingleparents.org founder. âEvery minute has to be scheduled.â

I want to be this really fly 80-, 90-year old.â

Cornerback Aqib Talib left Sunday&amp;rsquo;s game in the third quarter with what the team said was a hip injury; if it&amp;rsquo;s serious enough that Talib will miss time, it would leave the Patriots without their best players in all three layers of defense: line, linebacker, and secondary.
