    <body>Another year &lt;a href=&quot;https://newscvm.com/anderson-compounding-pharmacy-npi-e9bb.pdf&quot;&gt;anderson compounding pharmacy npi&lt;/a&gt;  For allowing himself to be used by Team A-Rod. The New Jersey orthopedist thought it would be fun going on a media tour Wednesday to dispute the Yankeesâ diagnosis of Alex Rodriguezâs quad injury (Grade 1 strain). Things didnât turn out exactly the way he might have planned it. The fact he was reprimanded by the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners in February came to light on SNYâs âDaily News Live.â And after being strident about his diagnosis during his first radio interview, on WFAN, he back-tracked in subsequent appearances. Not a good day for the good doctor.
