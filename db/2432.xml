    <body>Would you like a receipt? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/arionmedicalin-bf28.pdf&quot;&gt;mastermedi.com&lt;/a&gt;  Secretary Duncan&apos;s Department of Education designed a program to boost student achievement by strengthening the knowledge and understanding among teachers of traditional U.S. history. It is called the Teaching American History (TAH) grant program. One arm gives grants to local education agencies to work with experts in the development of innovative models of teaching U.S. history within the core curriculum. Another supports competitive grants to local education agencies. Promising &amp;ndash; except that funding for TAH was cut out of the budget. At the same time, this administration is providing a cold climate for for-profit educational enterprises, an attitude not in sync with the entrepreneurial spirit of the country.
