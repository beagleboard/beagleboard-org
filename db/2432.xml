The list has been compiled by an industry body, the Pensions Income Choice Association. It said brokers and advisers must obtain quotes from 80pc of annuity providers to be included. It is also concerned that brokers are failing to make clear that retired people can reject annuities, instead staying invested in the stock market and making withdrawals.
