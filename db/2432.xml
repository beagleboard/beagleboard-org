TIGHT-LIPPED BRAILSFORD â Dave Brailsford, the manager of Froome&apos;s Sky squad, insists his riders won&apos;t collapse again in the mountains like they did in Sunday&apos;s ninth stage. Paris-Nice winner Richie Porte and several other Sky riders were dropped on the first big climb.

But he held on, solo, to keep the yellow jersey. &quot;(Using) a boxing analogy, he&apos;s taken the biggest right hook he could face, and he didn&apos;t flinch,&quot; Brailsford said. &quot;You learn more from adversity.&quot; Asked what Sky&apos;s plan would be to avoid a repeat scenario, he said: &quot;I&apos;m not going to spell it out. I&apos;m not going to go into the details of the changes we&apos;re going to make.&quot;
