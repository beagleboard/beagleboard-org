The oarfish, the longest bony fish species, is rarely seen dead or alive and is thought to be the sea serpent of sailing legends.

I am certain that Obama would not disagree that laissez faire economics create a more dynamic economy, he just doesn&amp;#8217;t want it to happen without the government controlling it. What good would it be for politicians if we had a roaring economy that happened without them? They would rather have tepid economic growth for which they can take credit than to have free enterprise allowed to produce the results that made this country the richest country on earth in the first place. The &amp;#8220;middle class&amp;#8221; of which he speaks must be entirely composed of government employees because it requires zero government expenditure to create jobs in the private sector.
