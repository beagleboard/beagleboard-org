    <body>Sorry, I ran out of credit &lt;a href=&quot;https://newscvm.com/stop-methotrexate-during-infection-e9bb.pdf&quot;&gt;methotrexate psoriatic arthritis success&lt;/a&gt;  In fact, says Dr. Ateev Mehrotra , an associate professor of health care policy at the Harvard Medical School who has studied alternatives to brick-and-mortar doctor visits, convenience ranks high among the benefits of those alternatives. &quot;One aspect of health care costs we don&apos;t talk about much is patient time,&quot; he says. That includes time in the car, time away from work, time in the waiting room, as well as time with the doctor. &quot;When you start counting up all those hours, it turns into a huge amount of time, which adds up to a huge amount of money,&quot; says Mehrotra.
