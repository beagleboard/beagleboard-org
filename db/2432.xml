Since 1850, humans have dug billions of tons of coal and pumped trillions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas out of the earth and burned them into the air. This never happend in previous eras because the coal, oil, and gas would have remained in the ground. After WWII, the US built cars and urged everyone to &amp;#8220;see the USA in your Chevrolet.&amp;#8221; Regardless of make, model, or country, this desire to press a pedal for travel has persisted to this day. In the first decade of the 2000&amp;#8242;s, China passed the US in pollution and in car purchases, but the US beats China in per capita pollution; an American is four times as filthy as a Chinese, but the PRC has 4.5 times as many people. As a consequence, temperatures rise, plants dry out, and fires become more destructive. CO2 increases the amounts of plants, but dought leaves them prone to catch fire and burn readily. The US has spent over $1 billion in this fire season and must request people from other agencies to help. The Sequester means that some fires must be allowed to burn until they threaten a certain number of homes worth many dollars. The rich can gain fire protection, but the poor may need to defend themselves.

And the trend to automated ad exchange buying leads me to believe that the clicks don&amp;#8217;t even matter that much. I have seen an increase in popup, popunder, and rollover ads in the last year. They&amp;#8217;re making it as hard as they can to avoid seeing those ads, figuring that if one user in a (thousand? million? who knows?) clicks on an ad, whether intentionally or accidentally, it&amp;#8217;s worth the money it cost. Sort of like bulk mail, which appears to be disappearing as the internet fills up with junk ads.

If you travel to China frequently, the very fast growth is patently obvious. The cost of living in China is far lower than in America, which means their PPP GDP is much higher than the nominal GDP.
