    <body>What qualifications have you got? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elegantandwild.co.uk/medicinelyrics-queen-75b3.pdf&quot;&gt;medicalnet.ro&lt;/a&gt;  Miniature books &amp;ndash; books of three inches or less &amp;ndash; have been around for almost as long as full-size books. &amp;ldquo;They were created for reasons of practicality, curiosity and aesthetics,&amp;rdquo; says Edison, who owns two-inch clay tablets onto which ancient Babylonians inscribed cuneiform lettering in around 2200 BC. Within 20 years of Gutenberg printing his Bible in 1455, miniature printed books were being produced and for several centuries afterwards religious books dominated the market. Book-makers worked with magnifying aids and miniature tools, binding their creations in leather, and adorning them with gold thread and precious gems.
