So when geneticists make their estimates of last common ancestors, they take DNA samples from a large number of people, see how different those people&apos;s DNA are from each other, and then use some outside information to help them calculate how long it should have taken for those differences to arise. &quot;It&apos;s basically distance equals rate times time,&quot; says David Poznik, the Stanford University scientist who did much of the dating work in his the paper with Bustamante.
