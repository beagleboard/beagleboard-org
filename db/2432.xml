He did play well down the stretch, making birdies on three of the last six holes. But all that got him was a 70, leaving him at 4-over 284 for the week.

They will have 10 days off before playing the Bills at home. That seems like a soft landing spot for Smith: Jets Nation ready to embrace him, inferior opponent, 10 days to prepare. Thatâs followed by a road game in Tennessee, another game against a team about as bad as the Jets.

The Five States committed an act of genocide against the Kurds in 1980&amp;#8242;s. The chemical weapons provided by NATO also targeted Iranian soldiers and Kurds in Iran.
