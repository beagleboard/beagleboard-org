    <body>Could you send me an application form? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/stmap_e0f90.html?eregra.abilify.valproic.viagra&quot;&gt;nexium mups 40 mg precio mexico&lt;/a&gt;  Yet a significant proportion of British people &amp;ndash; particularly in the lower-middle and working classes &amp;ndash; are running out of financial choices. Inflation is high and wages are stagnant. Private rents are steep and social-housing stock is at a historic low. Desperation is re-emerging, and I applaud the Archbishop for engaging with it. The acquisition of fortunes cannot be divorced from moral behaviour, although we like to pretend it can; we have created a false division between the smart and the good. With his lending scheme, the Archbishop is struggling to reunite the two. I wish him Godspeed.
