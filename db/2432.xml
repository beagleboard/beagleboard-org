    <body>I&apos;m training to be an engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssvoverath.de/stmap_c3db0.html?viagra.stendra.acetate.zofran&quot;&gt;ironman mattress protector with celliant reviews&lt;/a&gt;  Anthropologically speaking, tattoos are fascinating, and as self-expression goes it doesn&apos;t get much more tangible than puncturing a needle filled with indelible pigment into your body. I can understand what drives people to do it. Besides the immediate endorphine rush, I imagine that it&apos;s validating to commit yourself to such a palpable personal transformation. I see the appeal of exerting control over one&amp;rsquo;s body; I admire the permanence of them, and like the fact that they are emblems of signficant moments in our lives. I can see the attraction of attempting to mould your external being to fit your idea of &amp;lsquo;the real you&amp;rsquo;. Sometimes the sexiest thing about a tattoo is simply the fact that the owner doesn&apos;t care what others think of it. &apos;Good for you!&apos; I think.
