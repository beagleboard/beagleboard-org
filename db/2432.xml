    <body>Thanks for calling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/equipoise-definition-legal-a6a4.pdf#jumper&quot;&gt;equipoise price in pakistan&lt;/a&gt;  Bulger lawyer J.W. Carney Jr. suggested that Weeks was a chronic liar who beat the system by striking a plea deal with prosecutors that resulted in him serving only five years in prison for aiding and abetting Bulger. Weeks acknowledged that Bulger gave envelopes filled with cash to numerous law enforcement officials to get tipped off to investigations and stay one step ahead of any indictments. The defense also asked the judge to suspend the trial for two days because Bulger was exhausted and they needed more time to prepare for the prosecution&apos;s forensic experts. The judge turned down the request but agreed to shorten the length of testimony on Thursdays.
