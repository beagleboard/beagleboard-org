As its next CEO, or at least that personâs right hand, the company needs a harsh, demanding product expert willing to ignore internal politics, focus group findings, or complaints about impossible deadlines. Such leaders (Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Marissa Mayer) are rare; Microsoft arguably hasnât had a world-class one since Bill Gates in his mid-â80s prime. But only a boss who insists that products be great the first time around can squelch the dread that has long accompanied a new Microsoft release.
