Actor Randy Quaid and his wife are facing burglary charges in California after the owner of the couple&apos;s old house reported they had been living there without permission. A representative of the property owner called Santa Barbara County sheriff&apos;s deputies on Sept. 18 to report that squatters had been staying in the guest house illegally. When deputies arrived at the house that evening, they found Randy and Evi Quaid, who said they had owned the property since the 1990s. The property owner&apos;s representative provided documents that showed his client had bought the home in 2007 from a man who had purchased it from the Quaids several years earlier. A contractor showed police more than $5,000 in damages to the guest house that he believed was caused by the Quaids.Police arrested the Quaids on charges of felony residential burglary and entering a noncommercial building without consent, a misdemeanor. Police also charged Evi Quaid, 47, with resisting arrest. Bail was set at $50,000 each.With News Wire ServicesFollow our photo galleries @NYDNPhotos
