This includes tackling the unconscious assumptions people make about leadership, which are influenced by our history of predominantly male leaders. So leadership is often linked in people&amp;rsquo;s minds with attributes such as gravitas and impact, which they associate with men. The effect is many women are simply not putting themselves forward for these roles as they don&amp;rsquo;t think they fit the mould. But also they are less likely to be perceived by others as leaders or having the potential to be a leader.
