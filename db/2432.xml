Rwanda is a country with historically little manufacturing, unlike neighboring Kenya, Uganda and even South Africa. If we were a larger company, we might have been able to recruit experienced &amp;#8212; and expensive &amp;#8212; manufacturing staff from outside the country. But we didnât have that option. Even if we did, that would be a short-term solution. So we partnered with American and Rwandan universities to train new graduates from the technical schools in Eastern Rwanda. As a result, we can afford to hire employees from the local community. Ultimately, our staff will provide expertise to others, keeping skills in-country.

That energy became infectious. The first gold medal was for competence in vast infrastructure projects. The second was for winning.

Cortonâs shimmering âafterlifeâ white walls give way to cozier, dark woods and leather banquettes. Kooky colander lampshades and streetlights jutting over the bar suggest a postmodern Japanese pub with whiffs of steampunk.
