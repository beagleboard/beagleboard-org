When Putney Park, a girls&amp;rsquo; school that occupied four Edwardian houses in south-west London, announced in February that it would close this summer, parents launched a rescue mission. &amp;ldquo;Everybody said, &apos;We&amp;rsquo;ll fight to save the school,&amp;rsquo; but they were all looking for another place for their child at the same time,&amp;rdquo; says Audrey Pakenham-Money, whose 11-year-old daughter, Isabella, would have started at the school this week. &amp;ldquo;The school left it late to tell parents who, quite rightly, thought of their own child first.

For instance, she said she&apos;d much rather have a device that works just like a point-and-shoot camera with a simple button you push that lets you autofocus by pushing halfway down and then snapping the picture.
