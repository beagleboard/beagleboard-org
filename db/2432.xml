The U.S. cannot pay the interest on its debt at this very moment. (U.S. debt is &amp;#8220;borrowed&amp;#8221; in the form of bonds &amp;#8212; they don&amp;#8217;t go to a bank) If you could not pay the interest on your mortgage or your credit cards&amp;#8230; your credit would cease (you could not borrow) and you&amp;#8217;d have to pay DOWN most of your debt or go BK &amp;#8230; WE CAN SEE Europe already failing (PIIGS = Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain but we know France and Romania, Yugoslav states (Balkans), most of L.

It happened in the 2009 crash of a Boeing 737 on approach to Schipol airport, Turkish Airlines flight 1951. The 2008 crash of a british airways Boeing 777 was almost a mirror image and the conclusion that ice in the fuel tanks was a cause was never proven. The Egyptair crash of flight 990 into the Atlantic followed the bizarre closure of throttles in flight The Egyptair flight was blamed on pilot suicide but that is just conjecture. The common thread linking these crashes with the Asiana crash is an uncommanded throttle closure whilst the aircraft&amp;#8217;s speed was being commanded by a computer system.

The reduction in benefits for people claiming at age 62 will further increase to 30 percent for everyone born in 1960 or later under current law.
