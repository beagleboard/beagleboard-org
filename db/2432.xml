They were compared to 1,393 randomly selected cancer-free men. The group that ate the highest amount of omega-3 fatty acids had about 2.5 percent more of the compounds in their blood compared to the group that ate the lowest amount. The difference corresponded to a little larger than eating two extra servings of salmon weekly, Kristal noted.
