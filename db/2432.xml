And occasionally treating it as if it is original to them. No wonder these people want to give Rodriguez a soft place to land.

Plymouth is struggling as its port declines and it is going to be hard for it to find a new role with such poor transport links, he says. About 15 years ago there used to be an &quot;extremely good&quot; Plymouth-to-Heathrow service. The airline was profitable, the airport just about broke even, and taken together the service was viable, he says. But higher airport charges and competition from Newquay hit Plymouth hard. A fundamental part of a hub airport is that it connects with the regions, he says. &quot;If we&amp;#039;re putting funds into areas for regional development then why not subsidise an airport?

The Ball Supper Room houses a video wall projecting film footage of the build-up: the Imperial State Crown being cleaned, for example, and the Earl Marshall, Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, who masterminded the event from his HQ at 14 Belgrave Square, discussing a model of the processional route with David Eccles, the minister of works. Linked to the film is a &amp;lsquo;soundscape&amp;rsquo; that includes horses from the carriage procession and the hum of crowds.

If growth picks up steam and the Fed only modestly pulls back in its $85 billion-a-month buying of debt securities, as expected, then it might be easier to overlook Washington gridlock.
