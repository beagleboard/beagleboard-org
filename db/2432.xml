And so when we see that women who drink less coffee also have more successful pregnancies we donât really know if thatâs just about coffee or whether itâs really a confounding factor from this nausea.â But coffee was just one item on a long list of forbidden, or semi-forbidden, items that Oster wanted to investigate. Alcohol for example. Some health services, like the National Health Service in England, recommend that women avoid alcohol altogether in pregnancy, but Oster says she decided that on the available evidence, she felt comfortable having three glasses of wineâin totalâin the first trimester, and then half a glass three or four times a week in the second and third trimester.
