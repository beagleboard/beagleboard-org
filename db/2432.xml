    <body>Have you read any good books lately? &lt;a href=&quot;https://oporajeyo.com/stmap_bf450.html?analgin.leflunomide.viagra.blopress&quot;&gt;acheter priligy 30 mg&lt;/a&gt;  Truong Tien Thao, who runs a small tea shop on the sidewalk near his home in Hanoi, Vietnam, is 65 and acutely aware that he, like millions of others, is plunging into old age without a safety net. He wishes he could retire, but he and his 61-year-old wife depend on the $50 a month they earn from the tea shop. And so every day, Thao rises early to open the stall at 6 a.m. and works until 2 p.m., when his wife takes over until closing.
