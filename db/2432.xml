    <body>Will I get paid for overtime? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/ullapharmsciorg-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;ullapharmsci.org&lt;/a&gt;  James took his lumps throughout the game, a bracing sight for the home crowd. He was jeered every time he touched the ball, and then both Garnett and Pierce hammered him on several moves toward the basket. The Nets bodied up to James in the lane, as they must do in their home opener on Nov. 1 â when facing Miami will be much, much harder. After scoring on one cute scoop play in the third quarter, James walked to the Net bench and teased Kidd about the basket.
