    <body>Sorry, I&apos;m busy at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/buy-rogaine-in-australia-aaa8.pdf#sunset&quot;&gt;women&amp;#39s rogaine topical solution amazon&lt;/a&gt;  The Yankees had hoped that A-Rodâs return to the ailing lineup would provide a spark. Instead, it seemed to energize the struggling White Sox, who had lost 13 of their last 14 games. Andy Pettitte was rocked for seven runs on 11 hits in 22â3 innings, putting the Yankees in a hole that was far too deep for them to overcome. The loss was their fourth in six games on the road trip.
