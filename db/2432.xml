    <body>I can&apos;t get a dialling tone &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/tadalafil-mas-barato-9e88.pdf#russell&quot;&gt;comprar tadalafil no brasil&lt;/a&gt;  There have been dozens of non-Muslim killers like Tim McVeigh, Klebold and Harris, Lanza,  Loghner, Cho, and many, many others. Some of them surely shouted out Jesus Christ, or some other religious curse as they methodically blew people away, yet people do not automatically assume that their religion made them do it. But when a Muslim goes postal, and shouts Ala Akbar, the non-Muslim cries for an murderous assault on Islam ring out loud and clear. People are all too willing to wallow in old anti Muslim prejudice  and mount another Crusade to free Jerusalem from the infidels and convert the heathens from their errant ways. However, there is no evidence that Major Hassan is anything other than another garden variety crazy shooter looking for publicity by pandering his story to Fox News. Blaming one fifth of the world&amp;rsquo;s population and declaring a holy war on a major religion is an irrational response to the actions of a single deranged Army Psychiatrist and is more about knee jerk religious bigotry than about the crazy Major&amp;rsquo;s actions.  The rabid foaming at the mouth of Islamophobes is just what Hassan wants, and people should be smart enough to deny him that pleasure.
