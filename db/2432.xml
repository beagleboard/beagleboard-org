For one, it&apos;s completely unique in the half-ton, or even the entire full-size truck market, for that matter. In the Ram 1500 line, the EcoDiesel has the lowest horsepower, but the highest torque output, at 420 lb-ft, of any of the engine options. Ram is estimating a 0-60 time of less than nine seconds, but did not get more specific. The power delivery of the 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 paired with the TorqueFlite 8 eight-speed automatic transmission is unlike that of either a gasoline turbo V-6, or a naturally-aspirated gasoline V-8. There is just a whiff of turbo lag off idle, but the engine quickly climbs to its torque peak, and we had no problem laying a few patches of rubber off-the-line with the EcoDiesel.
