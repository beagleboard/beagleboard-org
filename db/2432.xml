    <body>How many are there in a book? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/ordermedsonlineca-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;swiss-viagra-bx.info&lt;/a&gt;  Doubtless the problems will get fixed. All bugs are shallow with the president watching. In the meantime, itâs clear that tens of millions of dollars have been spent to launch something broken. (The actual numbers are disturbingly hard to pin down, another place where transparency would help.) And the Republican leadership has wasted no time making hay: Senator Lamar Alexander and Representative Darrell Issa sent a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services, demanding answers to a list of strongly worded, highly technicalâand fairâquestions. Speaker of the House John Boehner has called the rollout a âtrain wreckâ; Senator Pat Roberts has called for Sebelius to resign. We are witnessing the beginnings of the single most exhausting, hellish code review in software development history.
