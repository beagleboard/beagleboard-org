    <body>Insert your card &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/health-netpissedconsumercom-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;health-net.pissedconsumer.com&lt;/a&gt;  To create He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the essence of evil in the wizarding world, creature effects supervisor Nick Dudman and his team of artists subscribed to the theory of less is more. They used minimal prosthetics to make Ralph Fiennes&apos; skin look sallow and translucent, with veins running down his skull, arms and hands. &quot;The makeup is quite simple and strong in its design,&quot; Fiennes said in an interview. &quot;I wanted to wear as little makeup as possible, to be free to move. The idea is that Voldemort has just gotten this new skin. He&apos;s new in this body, so he&apos;s testing it, relishing the power of it.&quot; However, the actor did have to shave his head, arms and chest to play the role. In post-production, visual effects were used to digitally re-shape Fiennes&apos; nose, flattening it and adding slits to make it look snakelike.
