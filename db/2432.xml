    <body>Where did you go to university? &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/thehealthavengerscom-9392.pdf#composed&quot;&gt;healthpronetwork.com&lt;/a&gt;  Schioppo, who is 5-foot-10 and weighs approximately 165 pounds, said he couldn&amp;#8217;t break the rear side window, so he decided to punch through the back window instead. With water about five feet deep up to his neck, he was &amp;#8220;then able to climb in partially and grab him and pull him out onto the trunk. Then I handed him off to Dan and Josh and they pulled him onto the dock. Twenty seconds later, the car completely sank into the water.&amp;#8221;
