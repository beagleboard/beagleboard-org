Surveys show the public more inclined to blame Republicans than Democrats or the president for a shutdown, but each gets a significant share.

He worked as a painter in the popular abstract expressionist style of the time, at this point he using his little &amp;lsquo;snaps&amp;rsquo; as references for his abstractions. Then, in 1960, while browsing in a bookstore, Christenberry came across a copy of the seminal, &amp;lsquo;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&amp;rsquo;, written by Agee with photographs by Evans.

He showed the pictures to his grandmother. &amp;ldquo;Oh yes, that&amp;rsquo;s Mr. So - and &amp;ndash; So&amp;rdquo;, Mama Smith agreed. Christenberry was enthralled by the work and began retracing Agee and Evans&amp;rsquo; footsteps in his own work. &amp;ldquo;What they had done meshed completely with my feelings about landscape and those people,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Hale County was and will always be where my heart is.&amp;rdquo;
