    <body>Could I order a new chequebook, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/who-sells-extagen-5553.pdf&quot;&gt;extagen does not work&lt;/a&gt;  It is quite possible for Mr Miliband to pounce amid all the confusion. He could, in theory, amend the coming Lobbying Bill to vote through state regulation of the press. The newspapers would hate it, but he seems to enjoy fighting them. He could explain future unfavourable coverage as the sour grapes of Fleet Street bullies who have just met their match. And he&amp;rsquo;d be cheered on by Tory MPs such as George Eustice, Cameron&amp;rsquo;s former press officer, who says that statutory regulation would prevent papers from printing what he regards as &amp;ldquo;complete nonsense&amp;rdquo;.
