A tribute to English railway workers&apos; brew of choice in the 1800s, its name is an apt description. The ale pours a ruby color and the &quot;mild&quot; references both the English beer style and its easy drinking nature. Comprising English Maris Otter, Carafa I, C60, Special B and Samuel Adams two-row pale malt blend, its star flavor is caramel malt, with a light, toasted smokiness and delicate note of English East Kent Golding hops in the supporting cast. This slightly sweet, smooth brew goes down easy, and is not overpowering in either malt or hops. Samuel Adams Ruby Malt is only available in the Harvest Collection twelve-pack.
