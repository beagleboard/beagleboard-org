My basic routine calorie rate is about 2400 kcal; I add about 60 minutes of cardio (50/50 aerobic/anaerobic) per day (average, I do some rest days, some multihour days), which brings my total avg to about 3000-3400 kcal/day. By setting my desired weight change rate at plus or minus 1lb/wk, I get that with 3700 kcal/day or 2700 kcal/day. Neither of which involve hunger or deprivation or anything interesting, other than being careful about volume when eating 3700 kcal/day.
