Richardson faces a felony charge in adult court after his arrest Tuesday, July 23, 2013, for impersonating a Chicago police officer. He is scheduled to appear in bond court Thursday, July 25. In 2009, when he was 14, Richardson put on a regulation Chicago Police Department uniform and managed to fool officers who assigned him to traffic duty for five hours before anyone realized the masquerading cop was actually a middle school student.
