    <body>Could I have a statement, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/kamagradk-9392.pdf#officer&quot;&gt;kamagra.dk&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8220;There have been people here saying they were the ones who left the ticket here. But they are only kidding,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Nobody has been serious about it in any case. In the event that someone seriously shows up claiming ownership of the ticket, I would have to refer them to the city hall. They are the ones in charge of this issue.&amp;#8221;
