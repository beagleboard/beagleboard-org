That one comes from the spectacularly uniformed, the ones who treat that as a defense. What kind of positive drug tests did USADA need on Lance Armstrong - remember when he was defended so mightily as being falsely accused, to the bitter end? - when it built the kind of defense it did against that fraud?

To do otherwise leads to instability and needlessly slow growth and courts default and economic catastrophe. Equally, however, responsible fiscal policy requires recognizing that when economies are weak and movements in interest rates are constrained â as has been the case in much of the industrial world in recent years â changes in fiscal policy will have significant effects on economic activity that in turn will affect revenue collections and social support expenditures. In such circumstances, aggressive efforts to rapidly reduce budget deficits may actually backfire, as a contracting economy offsets any direct benefits.
