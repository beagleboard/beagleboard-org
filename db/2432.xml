    <body>I&apos;d like , please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.layeredonline.com/50mg-trazodone-street-price-dd54.pdf#given&quot;&gt;trazodone for depression user reviews&lt;/a&gt;  Honour-based violence works also in the same basis because they expect people to toe the line, they expect people ensure the honour of the family. And because honour is so central, if you don&apos;t break that cycle to let people realise that honour can be something different you tend to perpetuate that practice. So we do need to require that working with communities is central but it&apos;s also part of the package; working with key players, enabling statutory agencies to really understand their duty. Because what we tend to find, I mean with Forward, we&apos;re hearing very often, we get calls from statutory agencies who are telling us, &quot;I&apos;ve got a girl, I don&apos;t know what to do.&quot; Now I don&apos;t need to teach statutory agencies and tell them each time what&apos;s supposed to be done, it is the duty of government. We need people to be comfortable with experiencing response to FGM.
