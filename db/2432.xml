    <body>What part of  do you come from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelifesinsurancequotes.com/stmap_6f970.html?lasix.levitra.norpace&quot;&gt;synthroid 0.125 mg side effects&lt;/a&gt;  Cooper has written a highly readable and important work of the history of religion. She wears her evident scholarship lightly, but the text is suffused with personal, imaginative and emotional perspectives. From the prologue, with its memories of her childhood and her mother, to the epilogue&amp;rsquo;s fictitious portrayal of a virgin mother at the Council of Chalcedon in the fifth century, she abandons the detachment of the professional historian. While this can work well in the realms of human history, it seems to me problematic in the domain of religious history. This fine book, in other words, left me wondering whether Prof Cooper wasn&amp;rsquo;t having her faith claims and eating them.
