    <body>Who&apos;s calling? &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/japanese-drugstore-makeup-online-6a83.pdf#rested&quot;&gt;ziana online pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  In March, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/07/nasa-cosmic-blast_n_846333.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot;&gt;NASA&apos;s Swift satellite saw an unusually long explosion of gamma-rays&lt;/a&gt;. After studying the X-rays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/25/black-hole-eats-star-video_n_937150.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot;&gt;scientists found that they came from&lt;/a&gt; a black hole that had become reenergized when it devoured a star.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/aug/HQ_11-271_Swift_Black_Hole.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot;&gt;From NASA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Astronomers soon realized the source, known as Swift J1644 57, was the result of a truly extraordinary event -- the awakening of a distant galaxy&apos;s dormant black hole as it shredded and consumed a star.

These are the people who would show up at Tea Party rallies toting signs about the need to &quot;Take Back America.&quot; For four years they were assured by the conservative entertainment complex that restoring the America they grew up in was a real possibility. The vertiginous changes remaking the land could be ascribed to Barack Obama, an illegitimate fluke of a president who won only because of a one-off surge of young and minority voters powered by excitement about his historic nature and vapid &quot;hopey&amp;ndash;changey&quot; rhetoric. He was &quot;Barack the Magic Negro,&quot; in Rush Limbaugh&apos;s formulation. He was, simultaneously, helpless without his teleprompter but also a radical instituting a nefarious plan to sap America of its God-given freedoms.
