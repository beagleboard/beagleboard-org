    <body>How long have you lived here? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?loteprednol.cialis.requip.lukol&quot;&gt;pharmacistlegacy.com&lt;/a&gt;  With djay 2, an already-powerful app adds significantly to its unparalleled feature line-up, taking advantage of today&amp;#8217;s faster iOS devices with a new interface and library, a sampler for adding one-shots to your sets (with some samples included), high-definition waveform views that leverage Apple&amp;#8217;s Retina display, new effects, support for more outboard gear, and more.

On-paper, that&apos;s one ton less than the maximum rating for a Ford F-150 equipped with an EcoBoost V-6. Some buyers may see the capability gap as a weakness or shortcoming of the light-duty diesel drivetrain compared to the Ford. Cairns disagrees, saying that the line between light-duty and HD trucks has been blurred within the last few years. He blames that on competitors&apos; marketing departments. &quot;We do a lot of customer surveys and clinics. The light-duty (1500) customers are not asking for more payload or more towing. They consider all of the Detroit Three&apos;s half-tons essentially the same in terms of capability. The EcoDiesel will tow what a half-ton customer needs to tow. I&apos;ve said consistently for years, if you have a 10,000-lb or bigger trailer, you should be getting an HD truck, it&apos;s a tool made for the job. I think the target customer will recognize what a half-ton truck is made for, which is a towing range of 5000-7000 lb.&quot;

Two others were found Saturday â one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The bodies, believed to be female, were found about 100 to 200 yards apart, and authorities believed the victims were killed in the last six to 10 days.

While the current design still needs to be physically wired to a computer, the team is looking to add a wireless data transmitter, giving new meaning to the term &quot;Bluetooth.&quot;

Many of these tools can cost $100 or more. Sales data is not widely reported so it&apos;s not yet clear whether patients and their doctors are embracing them.
