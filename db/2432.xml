By measuring the inciting pulse and assuming that their drum could store and retransmit the quantum state of that pulse as they intended, the researchers were able to predict the characteristics of the second pulse with very high accuracy. A single such prediction has little meaning, but over 10,000 repetitions of the experiment the researchers were able to definitively prove that their drum was storing the information with a high level of fidelity.
