The new immigrant must pay this fee using a credit card or a transfer from a checking account. The immigrant can pay for accompanying family members as well. The government suggests you pay this fee immediately after the consul issues an immigrant visa. However, paying the fee is not a precondition to get the immigrant visa or entering the United States. By paying as soon as possible, the immigrant will get his or her green card soon after coming to the U.S. No matter, the first time the new immigrant enters the U.S., the immigration inspector will stamp the immigrantâs passport with proof of permanent residence valid for one year. So, the new immigrant has one year to get a credit card or open a checking account to pay the fee before the stamp expires.
