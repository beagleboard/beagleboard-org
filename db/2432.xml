Â In a culture of pluripotent stem cells derived from the skin cells of a Down syndrome patient, the XIST gene was inserted into the chromosomes through the use of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. The technique ultimately allowed them to cut each chromosome at a specific location in its sequence and then paste the gene into that cut site.

He ordered spaghetti pomodoro and a salad. I had the humble pie.
