    <body>perfect design thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proguaru.com.br/stmap_76840.html?vicerex.cialis.zidovudine.maxalt&quot;&gt;cialis pret fara reteta&lt;/a&gt;  It is unusual for a president to comment on a criminal case in this way, and conservatives have raised some valid concerns. Sometimes Mr Obama is calm and lofty in manner, at other times he is happy to manipulate social divisions to his partisan advantage. But as the first African-American president, it would have been perverse for him to remain silent. Race in America is the wound that will not heal; no amount of colour-blind idealism can escape the long-term effects of slavery and segregation, all of which are reflected in a justice system that operates unevenly. Compare the verdict in Mr Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s case to that of Marissa Alexander, an African-American who was arrested for firing a gun in the air to ward off her abusive husband. The Florida court sentenced her to 20 years.
