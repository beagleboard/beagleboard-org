The performance of the economy has cut the rug from under his feet. The next 12 months are crucial for Ed Balls. If he doesn&amp;rsquo;t pull a rabbit out of the hat he&amp;rsquo;s destined to plummet to mid-table mediocrity next year &amp;ndash; like his beloved Norwich City.

But the book took one of those surprising lefthand turns, and it evolved well beyond &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. It&apos;s still a love story. I love big, sweeping, epic love stories, especially love stories set in the midst of war, but it grew beyond that. It&apos;s not simply the love story of Cristina and Friedrich.

Their paths will cross again in 1955 when Serafina is investigating the murders of the Risati women in Florence.

We trust our friends, the Yelp community, particular bloggers or Twitter personalities who share their preferences and influence our decisions accordingly. From the consumer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, personal testimony is vastly more relatable than pure numbers, and we value reviews over ratings. How often have you looked at a Yelp or Amazon entry without reading the reviews?
