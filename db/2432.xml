Yet he is also an exemplary minister. A clever, thoughtful and decent man, he has worked without apparent friction for a Liberal Democrat, Vince Cable, while racking up a list of distinctly Tory accomplishments. Left to take the flak for the tripling of tuition fees &amp;ndash; initially the Coalition&amp;rsquo;s most controversial policy &amp;ndash; he not only pushed through the plans, but has seen the new settlement become widely accepted. More recently, he has made great strides in embedding the principles of choice, independence and competition within the higher education sector, not least by lifting Labour&amp;rsquo;s caps on the number of students that universities can accept.
