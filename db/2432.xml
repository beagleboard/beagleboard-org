These are more than numbers,&amp;#8221; said Cathy Schoen, Commonwealth Fund senior vice president and lead author of the report. &amp;#8220;We are talking about people&amp;#8217;s lives, health and well-being. Our hope is that state policymakers and health care leaders use these data to target resources to improve access, care and the health of residents with below-average incomes.&amp;#8221;

In September 2010, he and Bharara traveled to Seattle to discuss the possibility of Amazon acquiring Quidsi. While they were in that early morning meeting with Bezos, Amazon sent out a press release introducing a service called Amazon Mom. It was a sweet deal for new parents: They could get up to a yearâs worth of free two-day Prime shipping (a program that usually cost $79 a year). Customers also could get an additional 30 percent off the already-discounted diapers if they signed up for regular monthly deliveries as part of a service called Subscribe and Save.
