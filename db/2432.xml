The full Senate will convene for an unusual private meeting in the ceremonial Old Senate Chamber Monday evening to try to find a path through the latest standoff over delayed votes on presidential appointments. Barring an agreement, Reid, D-Nev., is threatening to detonate a change to Senate rules that would allow cabinet-level and other presidential appointees (though not judges) to be confirmed by a simple majority vote, not the current de facto threshold of 60 votes. Republicans are threatening to call Reid the worst Senate leader in history if he does it. They&apos;re also vaguely warning that they might change more Senate rules if/when they retake control back of the upper chamber. If this all sounds familiar, that&apos;s because it was Republicans on the precipice of doing what Reid is now talking about, back in the way-back days of 2005.
