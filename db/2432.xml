    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/stmap_a6a40.html?femigra.levitra.clavulanate&quot;&gt;may-med.com&lt;/a&gt;  However, there is an appeals process for any player suspended under baseballâs joint drug policy that could take at least a month. So it would seem the meter is also ticking for MLB if it wants to get the most bang for its buck on any suspension of A-Rod. For if during that time, it is determined A-Rod is unable to perform and is forced to retire, like Belle, he gets paid in full and the insurance will cover the Yankees for approximately 80% of the $100 million. Thus, a suspension of A-Rod after itâs been determined he is unable to perform would be but a Pyrrhic victory for baseball.
