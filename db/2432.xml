He wears soccer cleats. I donât know if much is going to bother that guy. I think he thrives on weirdness. The weirder you can make his schedule, the more comfortable he gets.â

At the refueling event, a massive screen entertained the crowd with old commercials for various gas companiesâBob Hope at a Texaco station, the Esso tiger bragging about higher octane. âGas is a weird thing to love,â Musk said.
