    <body>One moment, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?zyrtec.fosamax.viagra&quot;&gt;lyriana price in south africa&lt;/a&gt;  So I, no doubt like Prince William, had plenty to time for the obligatory pacing of the delivery room, and all that endless trying to look busy/supportive/concerned/wide awake. It was probably quite irritating for those who actually had something to do. &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you go and get a cup of tea for yourself?&amp;rdquo; a midwife suggested to me in a deadpan voice. &amp;ldquo;You look exhausted.&amp;rdquo; I was halfway down the corridor to the canteen when I heard the peel of female laughter that alerted to me to what was behind that suggestion.
