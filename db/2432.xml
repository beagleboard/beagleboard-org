    <body>Through friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/ephburn-25-reviews-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;ephburn 25 for sale&lt;/a&gt;  When I was a youngster, all of the luxury cars in the parking lot at church on Sundays and all the people dressed up in their &amp;#8220;Sunday best&amp;#8221; always struck me as rather disturbing given the content of the readings from the bible. The fact that one can feel that way as a ten-year-old says something very sad about the church. I&amp;#8217;m not religious these days, but I&amp;#8217;m still glad that the pope is making at least small strides in this direction. I hope the church starts stressing similar things among the laity. Either (A) start walking the walk if you talk the talk, or (B) stop talking the talk. Either option is better than gross hypocrisy.
