The Conservatives, intimidated by Labour&amp;rsquo;s perceived moral advantage in health, have wished to show that they worship the same false god. They have avoided any serious attempt to learn from foreign comparisons. They have not got beyond the &amp;ldquo;Surely you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be like America?&amp;rdquo; argument to look at all those systems &amp;ndash; such as in the Netherlands, Australia and France &amp;ndash; which, though free at the point of use, are based on insurance, and therefore make the patient someone the system wants to treat.

The rest are state-owned with a minority of shares that are listed and can be publicly traded.

Naturally, we expected that there would be reduced attraction between our grooved surface and the sphere, regardless of the distance between them, because the top of the grooved surface presents less total surface area and less material. However, we knew the Casimir force&apos;s dependence on the surface shape is not that simple.&quot;
