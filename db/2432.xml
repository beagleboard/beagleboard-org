    <body>Are you a student? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/sundhed-complete-male-9874.pdf#additional&quot;&gt;sundhed complete male&lt;/a&gt;  I firmly believe that &quot;Rights are Rights&quot;, whether you are, White, Black, Latino, Asian, East Indian, Blue, Green or Purple, Heterosexual,Homosexual,Lesbian, or Trans-sexual, if you are a citizen of these United States, you are entitled to &quot;EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW&quot;, BUT the the problem here, is that the Mormon Church, decided to back Andy Pugno and his band of crazies. I was appalled and disgusted, that this could happen, however you must realize that the Mormon Church &quot;RULES&quot;Utah, from most local government, on up to the U.S. Senate and House, Liberals in this state have almost NO voice. We do have a large LGBT community in S.L.C, and it is growing, and they are also quite safe here, go figure!! BUT THEN... &quot;THE CHURCH&quot; SNEAKS behind everyone&apos;s back and gives 8 MILLION Dollars to Andy Pugno, to Campaign for &quot;Prop 8&quot;!! AND THEN... Walks WITH our LGBT community in their annual &quot;PRIDE PARADE&quot;, I have NEVER seen such hypocrites in my entire life as those in the Mormon Church!!!
