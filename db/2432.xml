In her initial interview, she said the man responded, &quot;what are you talking about,&quot; while she said in court he responded, &quot;what are you doing around here?&quot; She also said she left out of her account to the attorney how Martin described Zimmerman as a &quot;creepy-a-- cracker,&quot; the Orlando Sentinel reported.

The problem is that in order to make them small you camera threw away any photo data it thought it didn&amp;#39;t need. That data is preserved if you shoot camera raw, you have to decide how your photo should be processed. Since you have more data to work with you can make a so-so shot look stellar. So, the poor little pooch comes out looking especially sad in my shot.

In America couples with unused frozen embryos have for years been able to donate them anonymously to infertile couples through IVF clinics. Estimates put the number of babies born in this way at close to 4,500. But those who have gone through a formal adoption process are far fewer. Embryo adoption as practised by Nightlight (and so far practised only in the United States) is different in that it treats the adoption of an embryo exactly like the adoption of a baby, and a social worker employed by Nightlight will conduct a &amp;lsquo;home study&amp;rsquo; to ensure that the home is suitable for the unborn adopted child. Legally speaking, this is not adoption at all since under US law embryos are classified as property rather than people, so all that is needed is an agreement between the donor and the recipient couple. And in US case law &amp;ndash; as in Britain &amp;ndash; there is no doubt about the parenthood of the child: a woman who gives birth to a baby is the baby&amp;rsquo;s presumed mother, regardless of the origins of the embryo, and the genetic parents relinquish all parental rights. Nightlight, however, encourages an &amp;lsquo;open adoption&amp;rsquo;, in which a child grows up knowing its biological parents.
