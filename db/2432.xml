    <body>Will I have to work on Saturdays? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?caduet.cialis.ondansetron.furadantin&quot;&gt;medfirsthausman.com&lt;/a&gt;  Just wanted to state a quick observation. Oscar De La Hoya had given the blueprint to Canelo in beating Shane Money just like he gave it to Bernard Hopkins against Trinidad. It&apos;s pretty easy. All he has to do is give Mayweather those quick stiff jabs to his midsection and top and he got him beat. Miguel Cotto was catching Money with jabs, but was slow and opted on that Jose Luis Castillo pressure, which made Cotto gas out. Although Canelo can&apos;t really match De La Hoya&apos;s jab, still it&apos;s enough to keep fighters honest. I&apos;m starting to believe more and more that Canelo may end up knocking Mayweather out, but who knows?
