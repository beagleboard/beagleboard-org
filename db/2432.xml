He came back for Gemini 10 as well, and then 11, and then 12, and nearly all of the Apollos, and Skylabs and shuttle missions that followed. By college, he was photographing the launches professionally. The only three manned liftoffs he missed in his long career were two of the 135 shuttle launches and that of the ill-fated Apollo 13 â a break both in his own streak and the Apollo program&amp;#8217;s run of luck. &amp;#8220;[Flight director] Chris Kraft later told me that he wished he&amp;#8217;d flown me down there himself,&amp;#8221; says Andrews, now 58.
