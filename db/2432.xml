Weâve all experienced this problem, of saying, âWhere can I find something like that?â â

The numbers on Walt Jr.âs cancer fighting charity website grow bigger. The stacks in the storage space grow higher. At this point, they can barely give the stuff away. When Walt tries to pay for a birthday breakfast, the waitress insists itâs free. Jesse tosses wads of it from his car and a good Samaritan reports it to the cops. Skyler hands a customer a five instead of a one and he demands the right change. Itâs the worst con ever, a perfect representation of how ultimately bad these guys have turned out at being crooks.
