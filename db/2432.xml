A raspberry mousse was delectable, and Italian doughnuts a fun accompaniment to the coffee, during which owner and one-time chef Giancarlo Caldesi nipped over during his schmoozing circuit of the room to chat about his native Tuscany&amp;rsquo;s cuisine. He is obviously a serious and talented cook, and has the handsome recipe book on sale to prove it, but we left feeling that with more inventiveness in the menu and less effusiveness in the service, his restaurant could yet challenge the big three for the honours.
