    <body>Sorry, you must have the wrong number &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/stmap_aaa80.html?viagra.cyproheptadine.myambutol.kytril&quot;&gt;www.datapharm.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;  On the surface, Brown should have been supremely qualified for Downing Street. He remains one of the most successful chancellors in British history and unlike Blair he is devoid of material avarice. He dominated the political landscape for 20 years and is a man of considerable intellect with a formidable capacity for work. But in office Brown stumbled from crisis to crisis â even without the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes. His internecine war of attrition to remove his usurper Blair poisoned the well of his support among Labour MPs. He ascended the throne more like Macbeth, and was beset endlessly by rebellions from within his own ranks. He ruled alone. He was a victim of the forces he had himself unleashed and his own terminal indecisiveness. The burden of the office of prime minister crushed him.
