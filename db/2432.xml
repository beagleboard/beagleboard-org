    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldnewsnetwork.co.in/stmap_08d20.html?torsemide.timolol.methotrexate.cialis&quot;&gt;nplhealthcentre.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;  Increased margins was a HUGE part in the decision to bring out the 5C.  Very smart move.  Last year the 5 was selling great but the 4/4S combined were capturing almost 45% of the iPhone sales.  That hurt margins big time because both are still very expensive to make.  With the 5C Apple is able to offer a &apos;new&apos; phone and protect its margins.  If Apple kept their same strategy (using 1 and 2 year old phones) the $100 cheaper 5 would kill their margins big time.  The 5 would be about the same cost to produce but would sell at $100 less.  I think the main lesson Apple learned last year is that many people are willing to buy a 1 year old phone that looks similar as the flagship (4S) but with lower specs for $100 cheaper.  Now the mid-tier phone looks very different from the flagship.  This will cause more people to pay the extra $100.  Very smart by Apple.
