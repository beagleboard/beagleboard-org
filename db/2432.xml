More than 400 half-timbered, beautifully painted houses fill cobbled streets where independent shopkeepers rub shoulders with traditional hostelries, smart boutique b&amp;thinsp;&amp;&amp;thinsp;bs, department stores and private dwellings. Check out the picturesque Schloss with its Hanoverian links and the oldest working theatre in Germany, as well as the Bomann Museum with its relics of local folklore from nearby Lüneburg Heath. You could have a fish lunch at the popular Nordsee café, luxuriate over kaffee und kuchen at Café Müller, get an evening beer at the rock-and-roll bar Herzog Ernst in Neue Strasse and have a gourmet dinner at the Ratskeller, housed in the 14th-century cellars of the town&amp;rsquo;s former Rathaus.
