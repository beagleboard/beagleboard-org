It is only logical that if the United States Federal government, State and local governments want to end their deficits then they need to take drastic action to provide the initial capital, i.e., seed money to help minority founded and owned startups. When their are more companies hiring then there are more people working across the U.S. This means that the U.S. Federal Government, State and local governments will have the Tax generated revenue they need to pay off their deficits. If people are not working then they cannot afford the services and products that companies design, develop and send to market. This in turn leads to a greatly reduced ability for government to raise taxes, and their only recourse is to cut programs that are needed. When they cut programs, then we have a substantial rise in Social Programs, and the government sinking deeper and deeper in debt.
