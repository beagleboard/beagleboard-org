    <body>Do you like it here? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/xlashcompl-6ae3.pdf&quot;&gt;buysteroidsusa.com review&lt;/a&gt;  A few more thoughts. Tax paying citizens are similar to a fruit or vegetable. They are there to be harvested whenever the World Bank, IMF or FED RES feels like it. Savings accounts are bad. Real money backed by actual assets are bad. Imaginary money that can be printed at will is good. WAR is the best thing ever, and peace is bad. People should have taxation without representation. Pork barrel spending for the shadow economy and for the MIC is really, really, really a good thing. Poor people and old people and disabled people and off-white people are really, really bad and interfere with all the taxes going to the WAR machine. Prisons and jails are a good thing that produce a lot of wealth and free labor. Arresting as many people as possible to get them is the &amp;#8220;system&amp;#8221; is a good revenue generating tool, while ensuring any &amp;#8220;extra money&amp;#8221; goes to the criminal non-justice system. Giving out lots of pills is good, while natural plants are bad. Giving out most of the farm bill subsidies to mega toxic farms and toxic meat factories is good. That way we have dead zones for the ocean. Creatures that live in the sea might swallow you or bite you and the bible says eating most fish is a sin. So why not just destroy them, oil and pollution are supported by the Bible, while nothing else is sacred. Trees are very bad and should be destroyed on sight. Cows and pigs are the best thing ever and their rights trump that of a human, any day. And, don&amp;#8217;t you dare photo a cow or a pig, photos of food are illegal. But, it is ok to photograph Paris Hilton&amp;#8217;s junk and post in on every magazine cover. Tampons are bad and guns are good. Tampons can be used as a &amp;#8220;projectile.&amp;#8221;
