    <body>Whereabouts in  are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/stmap_0bae0.html?levitra.hydroxyzine.nelfinavir.celecoxib&quot;&gt;nexgenpharmaceuticals.com review&lt;/a&gt;  Daniel Collins&amp;rsquo;s soda loaf is more of a brick. &amp;ldquo;I started making soda bread because the method is so easy, but every loaf is heavy and airless. I have made three, and thrown them all away. Shall I give up?&amp;rdquo; No, don&amp;rsquo;t, help is at hand from the experts. I learnt to make soda loaves from the Allens of Ballymaloe, who have a hotel and cookery school in Co Cork. They have published many soda bread recipes in their books, most recently in the excellent Master It by Darina Allen&amp;rsquo;s brother, Rory O&amp;rsquo;Connell. From his advice, it appears you are overmixing. He says just mix and shape the dough quickly &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Kneading the dough is unnecessary and will actually toughen the bread,&amp;rdquo; he writes. Keep trying.
