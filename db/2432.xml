Their path with Internet explorer is looked down upon by most developers as they rarely keep up to date on new Tech like CSS3, WebGl, WebSockets, Html5. While Chrome and Firefox tirelessly implement these. Anyone remeber IE claim about how fast it non hardware graphic rendering was with the fish example. Their implementation wasnt even actually 3d. Things like WPF are terrible and have found little traction. I think the best product they have put out in the last few years is ASP MVC, which is open source. The days of privatized technologies where a select few come up with ideas on it are gone. With things being open and so connected they need to be open for extension, but closed for modification.
