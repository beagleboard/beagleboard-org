I almost freaked out. There we were, in this very small storage compartment and the guy was sitting atop the missile like he was riding a bike. I yelled at him âHey man, what are you doing? We have no idea if this is active, if itâs a missile after all or just a whole bunch of worthless metal but when in doubt, Iâd rather stay clear and definitely wonât jump on it.â

The critic James Agate once described him as &amp;ldquo;a comedian by instinct, a tragedian by art&amp;rdquo;, which may seem a contrary statement to make about a man thought one of the great tragic actors of his time, but carries more than a kernel of truth. In company Olivier loved to make people laugh and on stage excelled in comic roles. The actress Jane Lapotaire recalls how, when playing the minor part of the butler in a production of Feydeau&amp;rsquo;s farce A Flea in Her Ear, he turned &amp;ldquo;a play about a woman who thinks her husband is unfaithful to her&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;a play about a butler who works for a woman who thinks her husband is unfaithful to her&amp;rdquo;.

The challenge culminates at the end of each of the eight stages with a boss battle against a Sentinel in an area full of light traps and trigger points that set off lasers. Having to work out how to avoid the glare of the Sentinel and escape the level really taxes your brain and there&amp;rsquo;s a real feeling of satisfaction gained from completing a stage.
