    <body>I came here to work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infocalcbba.edu.bo/zithromax-pharmacy2us-9e88.pdf&quot;&gt;zithromax pharmacy2us&lt;/a&gt;  I listened, dear reader, I listened to it all. I even noted the Twitters and emails of delighted Floyd fans, flooding in by the thousands from all over the world, people remembering being 17 and buying the album, how it&amp;rsquo;s still the soundtrack of their youth, wanting to know who was playing Emily, being told who was playing Emily by another Tweeter, castigating the BBC for putting this play on now when they didn&amp;rsquo;t play much Floyd back in the Seventies. I can sympathise with that. When I was 17 the BBC was more into Sandy McPherson than Stan Kenton, my musical hero at the time.
