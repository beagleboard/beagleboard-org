The very notion of an Internet company going after a high-margin service like video on demand without having the same infrastructure requirements must be infuriating. They have a highly unfair advantage and what do we see? They find a low-cost, low-data cap package on Bell&amp;#8217;s website and go whining to their investors that with data caps like that, Canada must be a 3rd world nation. Meanwhile Netflix secretly knows that the majority of Canadians don&amp;#8217;t own a base Internet package, they have a package 2 or 3 tiers up where customers have 5x to 20x more data allowance, which is enough for entire months of Netflix. So really, you are just seeing posturing from Netflix, they&amp;#8217;re acting like bitches.
