By one estimate, health information &amp;ndash; electronic health records, insurance claims, images such as CT scans, vital signs of people being remotely monitored by hospitals or smartphone, gene sequencing results &amp;ndash; will grow to the equivalent of about 500 billion four-drawer file cabinets by 2020, from a mere 10 billion in 2011. High-powered computers and new algorithms have the potential to allow physicians and researchers to combine and decipher all that information and see what connections pop. Ideally, medicine would then be able to better track and predict the spread of disease, and diagnose, treat and prevent it, all while improving safety and lowering costs.
