    <body>perfect design thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/rite-care-medical-center-miami-florida-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;rite care medical center&lt;/a&gt;  In its alert, the BBB says consumers complained about being surprised when their accounts were automatically charged after the free trial. In its response to the BBB, the company pointed to its terms and conditions, which allow the company to start billing for the e-cigarette as well as for monthly refill cartridges (which cost $59.67 plus $9.95 for shipping and handling every month) immediately after the 14-day trial period ends. (A heads-up: The 14 days includes the time it takes to deliver the starter kit.)
