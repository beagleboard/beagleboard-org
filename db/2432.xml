It could be information about your customers; demographic information such as age and gender, where they live, or behavioural information such as when and how often they shop, whether they buy from you online or face to face. It could be information about your products: which ones sell most quickly, what colours and features are most popular. It might be to do with sales, providing answers to questions such as: do you see peaks at certain times of the year, are sales patterns influenced by the weather, what kind of promotions work best.
