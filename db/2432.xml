The first was from the victim&amp;#8217;s ex-wife, Cheryl Canzani Oates. In her letter, Oates said her former husband would not want to see two lives lost as a result of this incident. She said she didn&amp;#8217;t believe Canzani would want to see Cordle receive the maximum sentence and that she believes Cordle was &amp;#8220;sincere in admitting he was sorry&amp;#8221; that he took another man&amp;#8217;s life.
