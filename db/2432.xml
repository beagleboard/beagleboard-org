After a delicious morning snack of ftair, a sweet fritter, we visited Chenini, where 500 villagers still live in caves in the craggy cliff face. A youth in a blue turban and baggy trousers proposed himself as our guide. Like many local boys, Nagi had spent several years selling newspapers in Tunis, but returned to look after his grandmother, and, he explained, to help preserve traditional customs and the Berber language, which locals still speak.
