Minson observes that most people donât make consistent eye contact. âYour eyes naturally go back and forth between the eyes and the mouth,â she notes. âThereâs also some time when your eyes just wander around.â Donât force yourself to look into the other personâs eyes more than you naturally would, she advises.
