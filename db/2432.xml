    <body>Who would I report to? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/stmap_bd820.html?viagra.viprogra.ovral&quot;&gt;medi-verbund.de&lt;/a&gt;  What if the diplomatic solution is successful in taking away his known chemical weapons? Do we just declare victory though the immediate central issue of their use was never addressed? What about what the president declared as a second objective, removing capability? There was a brief moment in 1991, as the deadline for Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait drew near, when the first President Bush waited half fearing Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would strike a deal allowing Saddam to save his army to fight another day. The goals then had been similar: to both force him out of Kuwait (immediate) and to defang him as a regional threat (removing the capability). Then, as now, the diplomatic outcome may not have be the best outcome for the world.
