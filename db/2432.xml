    <body>What&apos;s the exchange rate for euros? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/anjac-healthandbeautycom-b01a.pdf#remiss&quot;&gt;prinjapharmacy.com&lt;/a&gt;  Nasdaq did not respond to requests for additionalinformation beyond a statement issued to traders on Friday.

However, the main question is, did the biological father agree to the adoption? If he did not, then the child should remain with him. Also the well being of the child comes into question, she has been with the father for the past two years, and it would be very traumatic for her to be removed from his care. Also, the law regarding Native American adoptions should come into this. The simple fact is that this child should be allowed to learn and grow in her culture. If the Native American population had not been so decimated by past atrocities it wouldn&apos;t have come about, but it has and should be respected. The sovereignty of the Indian Nation is recognized by federal law and it does play a part in this as well. I do feel sorry for the couple, but this child is his daughter, not theirs, and she should remain with her father.
