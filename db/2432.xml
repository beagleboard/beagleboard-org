Unfortunately, it seems to have the same casing as the Surface RT which I found to be uncomfortable to use in portrait orientation. That&apos;s my preferred method to use a tablet so I&apos;d have to try the Surface 2 to see if it would work for me.

The demand for skilled labor has been increasing faster than the supply causing an increase in the wage premium for skilled versus unskilled labor. The average college grad in the 1970s earned 50% more than the average high school grad, today it is 100% more. Medical field professionals, computer programmers, and engineers are still seeing robust job and wage growth while those who have chosen not to invest in their own human capital have seen their job opportunities and wages decline. State funding to schools has been declining as a share of college and university revenue for decades not just since the recent financial crisis, and people wonder why tuition is increasing. If the gov&amp;#8217;t puts less money into schools, and the schools continue to provide the same, or in some cases more services, then tuition has to increase to compensate. And yet still the average student graduates with only approx. $25,000-30,000 in student loan debt. Before you say ONLY and point out that that is a substantial amount of money remember that it is less than the average price of a new SUV, truck, or even most sedans. Why is it that people have no problem spending $30,000 on a brand new car, which doesn&amp;#8217;t increase ones lifetime earnings potential at all, but shudder at the thought of spending the same on an education that substantially increases ones lifetime potential earnings? Until Americans get their priorities straight and start spending more effort on education in general, and math in particular, they will continue to see their annual earnings rise slower than inflation, or until the developing world catches up to the developed in terms of per capita GDP, whichever happens first.

I usually use my iPhone for a boarding pass, but had gone old school and printed one at home. Had my reservations, since I was headed to many cities. Bypassed all the crazy lines and was able to get through TSA and to my gate. Where I waited for two hours anyway, but, hey, no long lines with harried customer service reps! I also carry a photo copy of my drivers license&amp;#8211;it got me through three airports in one week when my wallet got stolen.
