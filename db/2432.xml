 &lt;a href=&quot;https://freelifesinsurancequotes.com/wellthy-enhance-6f97.pdf#bacon&quot;&gt;atp fusion review&lt;/a&gt;  Back in 2005 - when Premier League football was last played at Selhurst Park - striker Andrew Johnson was the league&amp;rsquo;s second highest goalscorer (behind Thierry Henry) with 21 goals. Could an Eagles player reach such lofty heights once again? Unfortunately for Palace fans, their Championship top scorer Glenn Murray (30 goals) will miss the beginning of the new season with a cruciate knee injury. At £4.5m, Murray is Palace&amp;rsquo;s most expensive player, but could be a nice addition come Christmas/January. Elsewhere in the forward department, club record signing Dwight Gayle (£2.9m) is currently the most selected CPFC player in the game. Unless the Eagles can add further firepower to their front-line before September, the 22-year-old former Peterborough striker is likely to fill the forward berth vacated by Murray at the beginning of the season. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect Wembley hero Kevin Phillips (£3.7m) to see too much game time!
