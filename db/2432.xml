The only thing he&amp;#8217;s doing is garnering publicity. Everyone in the Senate knows it. Most intelligent Americans, those who are even paying any attention, know it. But Cruz has figured that there are enough idiot Tea Party pathogens who will buy into anything they&amp;#8217;re told to make this little clown show of his pay off. Here&amp;#8217;s a guy who gets all his and his family&amp;#8217;s healthcare paid for by tax payers and an annual salary of $174,000 for railing against the government that he personally benefits from so handsomely.
