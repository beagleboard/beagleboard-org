    <body>Whereabouts in  are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?prandin.cialis.diflucan&quot;&gt;viagra jelly for sale in uk&lt;/a&gt;  One criticism levelled at the show has been that it can occasionally try your patience &amp;ndash; some episodes passed by without much in the way of plot development. In the last five minutes of tonight&apos;s instalment, however, with talk of evacuation rife, there were two big revelations. First there was Lucy stumbling upon a large group of as-yet unseen revenants. The second one, though, was more unsettling. Attempting to skip town with Victor, Julie (CÃ©line Sallette) and Laure (Alix Poisson) soon discovered that escape was impossible, when their journey repeatedly took them to the same spot on the dam. So everything is teed up tantalisingly for the finale. Let&apos;s hope for a satisfying outcome to this compelling series.
