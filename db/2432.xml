    <body>What sort of music do you like? &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?levitra.hydrochloride.medrol&quot;&gt;cymbalta 60 mg hinta&lt;/a&gt;  (Gene J. Puskar/ Associated Press ) - In this Aug. 18, 2009, aerial photo is downtown Pittsburgh located at the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers on the north side of Pittsburgh. Like Detroit, Pittsburgh was a community defined by its dependence on a single industry. But as steelmaking crumbled under pressure from foreign imports and the decline of the U.S. auto industry, the cityâs population dropped by more than 40 percent between 1970 and 2006, according to a 2013 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. But during those years, Pittsburgh also forged a new identity around health care and technology. Detroitâs bankruptcy canât be blamed solely on the cityâs reliance on one industry that itself buckled. Some point to the cityâs political leadership and its reluctance over the years to make tough decisions.
