Sadly, the rubber foot also didn&apos;t help the unit from slowly spinning it self around during extra low bass drops. Distortion at high volumes was minimal and no worse than what we&apos;ve come to expect from this type of kit. However, the speakers did sound a bit scratchy on certain tracks. Overall, Deck may prove to be an intriguing little speaker if the final shipping units end up with some tighter bass and slightly cleaner treble output from the drivers.

We have never tasted a single pod-cup that compared to a French press cup.

The driver did, however, apparently replace the windshield of the car before returning to the scene.
