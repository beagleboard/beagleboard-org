    <body>A pension scheme &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/stmap_51680.html?fluconazole.levitra.mesalamine&quot;&gt;doxycycline dose for meibomian gland dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;  We would be outraged if our army intervened and deposed an elected government in any western state, so why are our politicians not condemning it? It&amp;#8217;s total hypocrisy. This is a coup by any standards. I&amp;#8217;m an atheist and I don&amp;#8217;t support much of what Mursi stands for or has done, but he was elected by a majority in a fair election and he should be able to serve out his term. So much for our democratic principles: but then we are not democracies are we &amp;#8211; our system is monopoly capitalism and our politicians are subservient to the mega-rich. Look at Tony Blair supporting the Egyptian army, what a sell-out he is.
