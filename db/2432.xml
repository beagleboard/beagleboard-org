    <body>Will I get paid for overtime? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/stmap_55530.html?imdur.maxaquin.cialis.naprosyn&quot;&gt;kortspill.info&lt;/a&gt;  4. Common vs Private Value - In several goods or services markets, the value is very subjective. I may be willing to pay $4 per song of my favorite artist, you may not consider it to be worth it even for 50 cents. We each have different private values for the same good. The labor market for the most part is a common value market. Now this actually may worsen the problem for the unemployed because a prospective employer may think that it is highly unlikely that other employers who passed this guy over had very different value expectations. If my friend tells me that the latest Phish album is amazing, I think &quot;Hmm, who knows! I&apos;m not sure I like her kind of music&quot; (I hate Phish personally anyway)... but that would not be the case when it came to say hiring a house cleaner. There may be minor nuances but in this case, both I and her would be looking through very comparable valuation frameworks.
