    <body>Excellent work, Nice Design &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?actoplus.cialis.cephalexin.benazepril&quot;&gt;body-pharm.net&lt;/a&gt;  Williston is booming right now. I&amp;#8217;ve worked there since 2007, and oil has changed the town both completely and not at all. Whispers&amp;#8217; transition from typically tiny, haphazard small-town strip club into one trying to balance down home and big city is not working out too well, and it&amp;#8217;s an example of the boom&amp;ndash;bust cycle writ small. Capitalism&amp;#8217;s inherent gamble plays out on a small stage with a chrome pole while lessons in second chances and knowing when to cut your losses are there to take to heart or ignore. It&amp;#8217;s more America than anywhere I&amp;#8217;ve been. Some oil workers think improvements in drilling and fracking technology will sustain the economy for decades, but that&amp;#8217;s not my area of expertise. What I do know about is what it&amp;#8217;s like to revisit a place you hate again and again over the span of six years, watch it change, and realize you&amp;#8217;re watching history repeating and that you&amp;#8217;re just another camp follower along the frontier, profiting from mineral extraction booms, chasing opportunity and running from stagnation.
