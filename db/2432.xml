Ditto for the New York State of Health Marketplace. Its chief, Donna Frescatore, said on Friday that 65,500 people had âvisited and actively shopped on the site,â but gave no hint of how many of them had actually enrolled.

It agreed as a gesture of goodwill, to refund pro rata for additional pieces of cover FR had paid the card insurer for, and for insurance for the part of the holiday falling after the October 18 2013 - the cut-off date.

He served a seven year on-and-off apprenticeship to his father, Alex, carving out a modest career on the European Tour in between. He won exactly one tournament, the Kenyan Open in 1985, and qualified for the Open in 1979, the same year Ballesteros won. Harvey was almost reluctant to admit he dared imagine his father engraving his name on the claret jug instead of the Spaniard&apos;s that year. That dream died in a hurry.
