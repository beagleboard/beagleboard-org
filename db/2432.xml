    <body>I came here to work &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/amplified-wheybolic-extreme-60-ripped-reviews-31f1.pdf#duke&quot;&gt;gnc amplified wheybolic extreme 60 ripped weight loss&lt;/a&gt;  Serge quickly discovered, to his surprise, that Goldman had a one-way relationship with open source. They took huge amounts of free software off the Web, but they did not return it after he had modified it, even when his modifications were very slight and of general rather than financial use. âOnce I took some open-source components, repackaged them to come up with a component that was not even used at Goldman Sachs,â he says. âIt was basically a way to make two computers look like one, so if one went down the other could jump in and perform the task.â He described the pleasure of his innovation this way: âIt created something out of chaos. When you create something out of chaos, essentially, you reduce the entropy in the world.â He went to his boss, a fellow named Adam Schlesinger, and asked if he could release it back into open source, as was his inclination. âHe said it was now Goldmanâs property,â recalls Serge. âHe was quite tense. When I mentioned it, it was very close to bonus time. And he didnât want any disturbances.â
