Alexâs cold medicine must have been pretty powerful, because not long after he dozed off at the kitchen table, he woke up on July 3, 1776.

The implicit hope is that cancer either will not be stimulated in the manner that many people think it will; or else that even if it is, we&apos;ll find some other ways to get around cancer, somehow.

The issue before the court was not the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk but its constitutionality. I have zero faith in the impartiality of this particular judge â she seemed determined to embody the conservative stereotype of a liberal judge â but her reading of the Constitution is hardly bizarre.
