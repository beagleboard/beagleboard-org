    <body>I&apos;m originally from Dublin but now live in Edinburgh &lt;a href=&quot;http://stsmihajlopupin.edu.rs/rs/emeraldpharmalife-3c56.pdf#ministry&quot;&gt;emeraldpharma.life&lt;/a&gt;  Boxee CEO Avner Ronen recently sat down with me for a wide-ranging video interview on the state of television, and its future. His company just released a $99 device that uses the Amazon cloud to give its users an infinitely-sized DVR. If it takes off, the Boxee TV could fundamentally change the way cable customers consume content -- and the way they pay for it. Users will also be able to watch their recordings from devices like the iPad. Can Boxee play nice with an industry it&apos;s trying to disrupt? Ronen says yes. But between the Aereo lawsuit and the Apple TV rumor-mill, it&apos;s a crowded, competitive landscape. So, can the company keep competing with the next generation of startups that have the television industry in their targets? Please watch, and find out:
