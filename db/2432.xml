    <body>I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t catch your name &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/stmap_68650.html?trecator-sc.zydalis.emulgel.cialis&quot;&gt;long term complications of nexium&lt;/a&gt;  But I enjoyed Gregory&amp;rsquo;s support of the exciting theory that Prince Richard had been smuggled to safety by his mother and a poor page-boy sent to the Tower in his place. Historians such as Anne Wroe have certainly proved the Tudor account of the period to be unreliable. As Gregory writes in an afterword: &amp;ldquo;I cannot think she [Elizabeth Woodville] would have risked her daughter&amp;rsquo;s place on the throne for anyone but her son.&amp;rdquo; Making her a Good Yorkist but a Bad Mother? A Good Mother but a Bad Grandmother? Plenty there for the book groups to discuss.
