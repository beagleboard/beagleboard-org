    <body>What do you do for a living? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/medkuleuvenbeanatomie-e3c4.pdf#collision&quot;&gt;gbiomed.kuleuven.be&lt;/a&gt;  Our brains are equipped with what scientists call a &quot;mirror system&quot;. For example, the motor cortex of the brain normally allows you to move your own body. Your so called somatosensory cortex, when activated, makes you to feel touch on your skin. Your insula, finally, when activated makes you feel emotions like pain or disgust. In the last decades, brain scientists have discovered that when people watch other people move their body, or see those people being touched, or have emotions, these same brain regions are activated. In other words, the actions, touch or emotions of others become your own. This &quot;mirror system&quot; possibly constitutes a crucial part of our ability to empathize with other people, and it has been previously shown, that the less you activate this system, the less you report to empathize with other people. It has been suggested that individuals with psychopathy might somehow suffer from a broken &quot;mirror system&quot;, resulting in a diminished ability to empathize with their victims.
