In percentage terms, the largest decline was actually for households 35 and younger, who historically have lower rates than older, wealthier households. Over the last ten years, the homeownership rate for those 35 and younger fell more than 11 percent from its 2002 base, declining from a rate of 41.3 percent in 2002 to 36.7 percent for 2012.
