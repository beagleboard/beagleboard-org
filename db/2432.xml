    <body>I&apos;d like , please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wychwoodcabinetmakers.co.uk/british-drugstore-online-e0f9.pdf#weekly&quot;&gt;discount pharmacy helensvale qld&lt;/a&gt;  For years now, the common advice about this question has been to answer with a strength disguised as weakness: Say you&apos;re a perfectionist, or that you work too hard, or that you have trouble leaving work behind when you go home at night. But unfortunately for job-seekers who try these answers, interviewers are increasingly refusing to accept them. And that&apos;s no surprise, since they&apos;ve become well-known clich√©s that scream, &quot;I&apos;m giving you a fake answer to avoid an honest response to this question.&quot; Savvy interviewers will refuse to accept these disingenuous answers and will push back for a more sincere answer.
