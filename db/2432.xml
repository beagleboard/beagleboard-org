    <body>I can&apos;t get a dialling tone &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoeydeutch.net/teloyears-girl-8f08.pdf#dodge&quot;&gt;teloyears report&lt;/a&gt;  Sounds cool, right? The only problem: It didn&apos;t work as advertised. When the Motorola representative attempted to show that his DROID would only recognize his voice, he asked someone else to try to speak to it. And it recognized the person&apos;s voice. The rep was clearly a bit embarrassed and attributed the issue to all the noise in the room. Either way, the feature didn&apos;t really seem to work.
