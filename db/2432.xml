    <body>Yes, I play the guitar &lt;a href=&quot;http://kssgrp.com/customer-reviews-on-viswiss-5457.pdf#thickness&quot;&gt;customer reviews on viswiss&lt;/a&gt;  âThe unity of the human race, as envisaged by BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system. A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvelous swiftness and perfect regularity.â[Bahaâuâllah (The promised one), The Proclamation of Baha&apos;u&apos;llah, p. x]
