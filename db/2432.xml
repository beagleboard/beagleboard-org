At one stage I saw David Saker, the bowling coach, go out and give some instructions. Andy Flower, the team director, walked down to give a message to the 12th man, which is very unusual as he likes to operate in the background.

If the pilot hasn&amp;#x2019;t oversold us on production values that will plummet later, the show should be able to avoid the disappointing downturn that NBC&amp;#x2019;s &amp;#x201C;Revolution&amp;#x201D; suffered after &amp;#x201C;Iron Man&amp;#x201D; director Jon Favreau turned in a great first episode.

Likewise, babies have supersized eyes, and pandas&amp;rsquo; trademark black patches make their eyes appear larger by a factor of ten. (Part of a &amp;ldquo;facial mask&amp;rdquo; that likely evolved to repel predators, the eye patches seem to have the opposite effect on us.) Pandas are also one of the only animals to have a pseudo-thumb, a flexible wrist bone that allows them to manipulate objects in a cunning manner. They can stand on their hind legs, they like to frolic in the snow&amp;mdash;the list goes on. They even somersault.
