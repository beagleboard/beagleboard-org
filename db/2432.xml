    <body>Another year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yoriko-ballet-studio.com/stmap_f0470.html?cialis.isordil.aripiprazole&quot;&gt;coastcaremed.com.au&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;The teacher was just lying there and he was limp,&quot; he told KOLO. &quot;And me and five other friends went to him and said come on we&apos;ve got to get him to safety. We picked him up, carried him a little bit far and we left him because our vice principal came along and said go, go, go get to safety, get to safety. So we left the teacher there and we went to safety.&quot;
