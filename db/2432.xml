    <body>I&apos;m on a course at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/stmap_b01a0.html?micardis.avana.viagra.cordarone&quot;&gt;fenburn uk&lt;/a&gt;  By the year 2015, Gartner predicts Apple will surpass Microsoft in terms of total marketshare, which includes not only Mac and PC computers but also the mobile devices from both companies. That feat was thought unheard of a few years ago when Apple had a mere five percent or so of the computer market and Windows had all the rest. But Apple&amp;#8217;s mobile devices like the iPad have been wildly popular while Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Surface tablets have not been, and that combined with the steep falloff in PC sales has turned the tables. That PC slide has been blamed on a combination of users favoring tablets over PCs and users distaste for Windows 8 specifically.
