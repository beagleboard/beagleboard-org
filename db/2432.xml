Both sides know that they need to rebuild trust with the voters after years of slash-and-burn partisanship.

They manned check points outside the city but had withdrawn to strategic sites they had seized (airports, hotel complexes, and farms of presumed loyalists). Or else they were hiding in plain sight, donning an armband with the emblem of state authority, working on government security contracts. These days, the bands of Mad Max-looking guerrillas that had been parading through the streets and firing into the air after liberation were no longer in sight. UntilÂ suddenly they were.

In 1992, Yamauchi had to overcome opposition from Commissioner Fay Vincent (who had questions about foreign ownership) to purchase the Mariners. At the time, the Mariners had been unable to find a buyer willing to keep the team in Seattle, which is where Nintendoâs U.S. headquarters is located. In the 22 years he owned the team, however, Yamauchi never once saw the Mariners play in person â even last year when they opened the season in Japan against the Aâs. Yamauchiâs death further clouds an uncertain winter for the Mariners in which the jobs of GM Jack Zduriencik and president Chuck Armstrong, not to mention manager Eric Wedge, are all said to be in jeopardy. Already there is speculation the team will now be put up for sale.
