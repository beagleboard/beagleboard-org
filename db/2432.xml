It&apos;s not easy. Phil (Mickelson) played unbelievable at the British Open and no one was going to beat him that day.

Scientists are not often celebrated as cultural figures â normally that distinction goes to musicians, actors, sports stars, and even highly paid entrepreneurs.Â  Those responsible for stem-cell research, new forms of solar energy, or new ways in which the body can absorb drugs â as the Millennium Technology Prize winners have been â are not often given the public recognition that they deserve.Â  Many scientists see such recognition as more of a burden than a gift, so far more important is that prizes give an opportunity for public attention to focus on the technologies themselves, helping increase literacy about science.Â  Itâs an unavoidable fact that humanising these scientific leaps through telling the story of their discovery helps reach people who would never otherwise read about science. The human drama of a prize can bring the science alive.
