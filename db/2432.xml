    <body>Is this a temporary or permanent position? &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/dermacrine-pct-65ef.pdf&quot;&gt;dermacrine user reviews&lt;/a&gt;  With no end in sight to the donnybrook over the shutdown, still another big confrontation is looming. This will be a fight over raising the debt ceiling when the government&apos;s borrowing authority is expected to run out in mid-October. It&apos;s a battle that promises to be just as difficult as the current one.

This looming shutdown makes for a good moment for House Republicans to try and force at least some entitlement reform to address the long-term budgetary challenges that Social Security and Medicare, in particular, face. It is not a good moment to ask for the full surrender of all power to one house of Congress: if that were what the founders had in mind, they would not have gone through the trouble of creating a second house of Congress and an executive branch to jointly deal with budgetary issues.
