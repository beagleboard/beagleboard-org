China and Japan are thebiggest foreign holders of Treasuries.

But behind him last Tuesday, scrawled onto the ornate stone facade of the building, the word &quot;rapist&quot; could still be seen, even after efforts that morning to scrub it off. A faded blue arrow sprayed above the graffiti letters still pointed to an apartment window, still condemning whoever lived in that first-floor home.

The best third basemen are Juan Uribe and Placido Polanco; the best shortstops are Clint Barmes, Stephen Drew and Jhonny Peralta; the best starting pitchers are Bronson Arroyo, A.J. Burnett (been there, done that), Bartolo Colon, Matt Garza, Tim Lincecum, Ervin Santana and Ricky Nolasco, most of whom are expected to re-sign with their present teams. There are some top-flight outfielders, Shin-Soo Choo, Carlos Beltran and Jacoby Ellsbury, and a couple of quality first-string catchers, Brian McCann and Saltalamacchia, but all of them figure to command big bucks. And even if the Yankees are able to get out from under Alex Rodriguezâs $25 million next year, how much can they spend on free agents, including Cano, and still get under that $189 million luxury-tax threshold? And there is also this to consider: In years past, the Yankees had an added advantage in the free-agent market besides just money: As a team that was always assured of being a World Series contender, players wanted to come to the Bronx. Now they are back to where they were during George Steinbrennerâs manic â80s, a purgatory the Mets have been mired in, seemingly forever, without a championship-caliber team and having to overpay for free agents in order to get them to come to New York.

The street had no barriers, which allowed a crowd of well-wishers to swarm the car and reach through the open window to touch the pontiff. Bodyguards moved in to push back the crowd. At one point, the crowd was so heavy that the car was forced to a halt.
