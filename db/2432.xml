    <body>The National Gallery &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/stmap_bd820.html?toradol.revia.diarex.levitra&quot;&gt;fleming medical center dallas oregon&lt;/a&gt;  The U.N.&apos;s evidence doesn&apos;t look any better for the Assad regime when it comes to the munition&apos;s rocket motor. This portion of the munition may represent a 122mm artillery rocket (though a separate impact site has a motor that the U.N. identifies as part of a 140mm artillery rocket) modified with multiple large, fixed stabilizer fins and reinforced with a tail ring. These large fins give aerodynamic balance to the munition&apos;s heavy and clumsy front end. Because the stabilizer ring is permanently affixed to the munition&apos;s rear section, the modified rocket would no longer fit into whatever launcher tube it was originally associated with. The motor portion and the weapon would have to have a new launcher of approximately 36 centimeters in diameter; this might be made from scratch, or the ring and warhead might have been designed to the particular diameter of an existing rocket launcher.
