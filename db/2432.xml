 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/nepalimedlu-9874.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmacy.hourcenter.org.tw&lt;/a&gt;  Well once again the rich content monopoly wants to stifle innovation and shore up their control over you and the media. I have been using Aereo for a few months now and don&amp;#8217;t understand what all the fuss is about. It is simply like the antenna on my house could actually get a reasonable signal all the way out in the burbs. So essentially I feel like I am renting the Aereo&amp;#8217;s antenna that is close to the point of broadcast so I can get the over the air content I normally cannot get. That&amp;#8217;s all it is. The content monopoly doesn&amp;#8217;t want it to catch on because it means an end to their control over you. If they truly wanted to end this then start your own company like this and stop trying to exert undue influence over the market with your political allies as well as sitting on your laurels. It is obvious from the growth of this start-up that this is what your customers want&amp;#8230; but no one ever accused a cable company of caring what it&amp;#8217;s customers wanted.
