Researchers at Boston Children&apos;s hospital followed 1,312 babies and mothers from 1999 to 2010. They found out how many of those children were still consuming their mothers&apos; milk at their first birthday, and then tested the children&apos;s intelligence at ages 3 and 7.

She thought she was going to get away with this murder.

At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.

When we talk about rights today, we rarely think of just how many there are, and how often they&amp;rsquo;re infringed upon or taken away. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget that the rights many take for granted are the very same others die fighting for.

That is the one place, and it is a big one, where Verlander still has work to do to cement his reputation. Getting back there this year will require the Tigers knocking off the Boston Red Sox and their juggernaut lineup in the American League Championship Series. But it is thanks to Verlander that the Tigers have that chance.
