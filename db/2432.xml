The law was passed in 1998 in response to the killing of Heather Messenger by her husband in their Chaplin home, because trooper staffing levels at the time resulted in the nearest trooper being 18 minutes away from Messenger&apos;s home when she called 911.

The U.S.  abandonment of President Hosni Mubarak in the middle of the Arab revolution in Egypt, and more recently the U.S. refusal to provide anything other than humanitarian aid in Syria, sent messages to the Saudi royal family, among others, about our disengagement from the region and of America&apos;s unwillingness to counter Iranian adventurism.
