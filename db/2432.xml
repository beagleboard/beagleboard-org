(to use an obsolete phrase). I doubt it. And at a more fundamental level, they&amp;rsquo;re misleading because they play up to the prejudice that mind is the same as brain, and we can discuss our mental life as if human beings really are no different to a &amp;ldquo;brain in a vat.&amp;rdquo; I think music helps us to understand why this is such a suspect idea. We are not brains in vats, we are embodied creatures, and &amp;lsquo;mind&amp;rsquo; - that is, the experience of being a living, feeling thing &amp;ndash; is surely spread out through that body. In any case, the musical experience doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop at the boundary of the individual person. Music is a social thing, connected to dancing and singing. It becomes most vividly alive in those moments when we do it, rather than passively witness it.
