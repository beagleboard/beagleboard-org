    <body>I read a lot &lt;a href=&quot;http://archieandtherug.com/journalhealthpolicycn-9392.pdf#song&quot;&gt;pacificmedicalsystems.com&lt;/a&gt;  Sports stars are endorsing products to everyone, not just kids. It is up to the parent(s) to allow the kid to drink/eat the âcalorie-riddenâ consumables. At the end of the day, Iâd take a cool mill to say that Gatorade is good for you. (Gatorade is, in fact, good for people who work outâ¦but if you donât burn the calories youâll get fatâjust like with anything else that has sugar and calories.)

You&amp;rsquo;re better off not insisting that the plate is clean. Your children are more likely to grow up paying attention to internal cues (whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re hungry) rather than external (whether or not their plate is clean) when they decide when to stop eating, which is a good thing.
