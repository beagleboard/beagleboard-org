Staffers, city officials, advocates for the homeless, and clients who had to make their way through it are all glad it&amp;#8217;s gone. The E.A.U. was a windowless brick building with small, bare, ill-smelling waiting rooms. Hundreds of people, including the very old and infants, routinely spent the night there. In 2002, a sixteen-year-old boy killed himself when he learned that his family had to go back there. Linda Gibbs, now the deputy mayor in charge of Health and Human Services, which includes the Department of Homeless Services, was Mayor Bloomberg&amp;#8217;s first D.H.S. commissioner. She took the new mayor on a tour of the E.A.U. one Sunday morning in 2002. &amp;#8220;He was literally stepping over the sleeping kids all over the floor,&amp;#8221; she told me.
