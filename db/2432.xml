    <body>I saw your advert in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weymouthskatepark.co.uk/torrance-pharmacy-kaiser-6ae3.pdf&quot;&gt;torrance pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  That obviously didn&apos;t happen, as Thomas moved during the 2011-12 season and then took the next year -- his final one under contract with the B&apos;s -- off from hockey. The Bruins dealt him to the Islanders in a move that was only made to help New York reach the cap floor.
