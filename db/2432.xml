They still don&amp;#8217;t have the leadership including a fresh Board of Directors to move ahead instead of wallowing in their failure and missed opportunities. The creativity needed is already in place i.e. it e employees who are undervalued, mismanaged and blamed for the failures of the leadership and Board. Morale is so low it can crawl under the belly of an ant. It&amp;#8217;s time to reinvigorate and empower employees creating new products that will light a fire under what once was one of the finest and most creative companies in the world. The choice of Meg Whitman was not a wise one but what can be expected of a an ossified Board that lacks imagination and apparently also lacks business acumen. That is a double headed disaster that require urgent action but by whom? Shareholders are disempowered and there is nothing to stop the coming slide except, dare it be said, bankruptcy. What a shame to run this magical corporation into the ground.
