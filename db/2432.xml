Taxis, hairdressers, public notaries andmany others are governed by &quot;obsolete regulation,&quot; according toan official 2008 report on ways to open up the French economy,written by Jacques Attali, a writer, consultant and former topgovernment official, who argued that it was time to blow up therules and liberate producers and consumers alike in order tocreate jobs and give a boost to the economy. Among other things,he recommended eliminating a 1973 rule that limits the numbersof bars with alcohol licenses; enabling hairdressers with fiveyears experience to open a salon without having to pass aspecial exam; dumping a quota system that limits the number ofpharmacies, and breaking a taxi monopoly in Paris that restrictsthe number of cabs in the French capital and can make it hard tofind one at peak hours or when it&apos;s raining.
