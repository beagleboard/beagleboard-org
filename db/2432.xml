Damaged coils in your air conditioner can cause the coolant to leak out, requiring it to do double duty to produce a nice cool breeze.

There is a chance heâll sit out the next two preseason games.

It remains unclear who fired the first shot. The military maintains it fired in self-defense and the Muslim Brotherhood maintains that soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration.

He already has 14 catches for 273 yards this season, with four touchdowns; last year, when he nursed a knee injury and acknowledged he wasn&apos;t always sure what he was doing, he had 26 catches for 213 yards all season (with no touchdowns).
