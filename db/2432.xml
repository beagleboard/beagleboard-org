Yes, other countries have stricter drunk driving laws, but theyâre generally smaller nations with better public transportation systems and a lot fewer highway cops.

Attacking the current &amp;ldquo;persecution&amp;rdquo; of motorists, which is helping to kill off small shops, he argues: &amp;ldquo;We need to give people the good grace to pop into a local corner shop for 10 minutes, to buy a newspaper or a loaf of bread without risking a £70 fine.&amp;rdquo;
