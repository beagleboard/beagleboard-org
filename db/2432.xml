    <body>How many would you like? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/promethazine-syrup-dm-high-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;phenergan syrup paediatric dose&lt;/a&gt;  BT, in its defence, said the report was simply wrong and failed to take on board the company&amp;#8217;s detailed submissions to the PAC. &amp;#8220;We have been transparent from the start and willing to invest when others have not,&amp;#8221; a BT spokeswoman sgtated. &amp;#8220;It is therefore mystifying that we are being criticised for accepting onerous terms in exchange for public subsidy â terms which drove others away. The taxpayer is undoubtedly getting value for money,&amp;#8221; she said.

But Trump runs some sort of seminar camp in which he charges people up to $35,000 to hear hand-picked speakers talk about how to do the &quot;art&quot; of the Trump real estate deal, according to a complaint by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. It&apos;s not an actual university &amp;ndash; that is, it doesn&apos;t award degrees. And even the dangling carrot of the institution &amp;ndash; the hope of actually getting to meet The Donald &amp;ndash; wasn&apos;t realized by many students (or, &quot;students&quot;) who, Schneiderman said, had to settle for a photo of themselves next to a cardboard cutout of Trump.
