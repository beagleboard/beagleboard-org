I went to the doctor after falling down some stairs, but all he said was, &amp;ldquo;Lay off the beer.&amp;rdquo; I became even more clumsy after moving to Cambridge. At Christmas, when I went skating on the lake at St Albans, I fell over and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get up. My mother noticed these problems and took me to the family doctor. He referred me to a specialist, and shortly after my 21st birthday I went into the hospital for testing. They took a muscle sample from my arm, stuck electrodes into me, and then injected some fluid into my spine and, with X-rays, watched it go up and down as they tilted the bed. After all that, they didn&amp;rsquo;t tell me what I had except for saying that I was an atypical case. I gathered, however, that they expected it to continue to get worse and that there was nothing they could do except give me vitamins.

After candid discussions, the NCAA asked us to provide additional information and indicated it would study our suggestions. Because time is of the essence regarding these issues, we have asked for the NCAA&apos;s response as soon as practical.&quot;
