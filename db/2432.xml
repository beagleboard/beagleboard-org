    <body>It&apos;s a bad line &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglobalelite.org/stmap_69bc0.html?vigora.butenafine.levitra&quot;&gt;theharvarddruggroup.com&lt;/a&gt;  I was lucky to be at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and I have to say I didn&apos;t realize how many people in politics and in D.C. were obsessed with the show. It was probably the biggest form of flattery and compliments. Across the board, we were all given praise for representing and, for me specifically, praised by a lot of journalists and people at BuzzFeed &amp;ndash; which Slugline [the blog Janine writes for] is a little based on &amp;ndash; doing social media. They were excited that I was representing old school writing and trying to get your facts versus just putting it out there and making mistakes. We were all very, very blown away by the reaction, even from someone like Chris Matthews. They knew all of our names, knew all of our characters, and asked us very specific, detailed questions about, &quot;How did you do this?&quot; and &quot;How did you come up with this?&quot; and &quot;Where did this come from?&quot; It was phenomenal to walk into a world that I don&apos;t know very much about and feel like we were one of them, like we were part of D.C. politics even though we were just actors on a TV show.
