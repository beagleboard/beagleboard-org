Hotel mode can also inhibit the TV&amp;rsquo;s external inputs, so you cannot connect your video game, laptop or tablet to the TV to watch a movie or play games. The lack of adjustment would be okay if the TVs in question were properly set up in the first place, many are not and in my experience reception staff rarely know how to change settings. On the understanding that you promise not to have it too loud, and return the TV to its previous state when you leave, the trick is to Google the TV&amp;rsquo;s make and model number, followed by the words &amp;lsquo;hotel mode&amp;rsquo;. Nine times out of ten this finds the service code and instructions for disabling hotel model. For future reference on many recent Philips models press the following keys in rapid succession: 3-1-9-7-5-3-mute and this lets you to access the setup menus.
