This is compared to fiscal year 2008, when Obama came into office, of $37.6 billion. In other words, not only has Obama added over 13 million people onto the government rolls, but he has also more than doubled the cost of the program. In just 4 years. Simply administering the program itself costs nearly $4 billion per year.

But the truth is detoxes and cleanses arenât right for everyone, and they can even backfire.

Until now, the spacecraft hasn&apos;t been able to use its visual and infrared spectrometer to see these vast expanses of liquids, but through a combination of fortunate events, the clouds parted to allow us a peek down onto Titan&apos;s surface.
