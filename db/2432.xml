The stations started pushing to be the first one to get me on, and saying that if I were on one station early in the day, I couldnât be on another station later that day. Eventually CNBC started to ask me for an exclusive relationship. I had friends on both sides of the divide and was hesitant to choose one over the other. But on the other hand, the invitations were becoming a real burden for me and it seemed like I was on TV almost every day. Eventually CNBC offered to pay me to appear as a guest on the show, but only if I were willing to stop going on Fox. I was unsure whether to take the deal. Larry called me one day and asked me personally to come on board and help him to fight the good fight among the liberals in the world of CNBC. I agreed. How could I not? The deal would cut my appearances down to two or three per week, allow me to fight for the principles I believed in, and pay me, to boot.
