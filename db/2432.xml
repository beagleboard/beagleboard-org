    <body>Have you read any good books lately? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/cortigon-0bae.pdf&quot;&gt;cortigon amazon&lt;/a&gt;  Option two is more useful for you for several reasons. First, it gives you an answer on the spot. If you used the comment box option, you stand a high chance that your manager may ask to think about it and get back to you. You also stand a high chance that your manager will not get back to you unless your issue is mission critical for him because he has too many other &quot;To Dos&quot; to address. Even a manager who has every intention of getting back to you is at the mercy of an ever-mounting list of priorities. He may simply get distracted and now you have to follow up on your request again. Third, a multiple choice question demonstrates that you have thought through the issues, narrowed the options and just need a more senior consultation. It is simple, concise and actionable.
