Like it says in the article the Boys&amp;#8217; are missing some big pieces in that DLine of course no one in the media has mention that excepts here, and expect Romo and Dez to just roll all over us. I know we have are issues but they got theirs&amp;#8217; too. I hope we come out and run the ball down their throat and then it won&amp;#8217;t matter what Dez and Romo do as they&amp;#8217;ll be on the sidelines mostly. Can&amp;#8217;t wait for this game exciting!!
