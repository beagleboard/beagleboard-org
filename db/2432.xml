    <body>I&apos;ll call back later &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-matchbox.com/ibuprofen-before-cataract-surgery-5522.pdf&quot;&gt;how many ibuprofen should i take for swelling&lt;/a&gt;  This one&apos;s not exactly true or false, but scientists do seem to be getting better and better at finding long-term solutions for treating trouble spots. The most recent and promising procedure is a surgery called Cellulaze, approved by the FDA in 2012, in which an optic laser melts fat, breaks up fibrous connective tissue and stimulates the growth of new collagen, all through a pinhole-sized incision in the skin. &quot;It&apos;s great because it works on both those fibers that are pulling down your skin and on the fat globules that are popping through,&quot; says Karcher. Recovery is quick, too: &quot;You might be a little bit sore afterward, but you can have it done on a Friday and be back to work by Monday.&quot; The treatment starts at about $3,500 per leg, but results seem to last at least a year or two.
