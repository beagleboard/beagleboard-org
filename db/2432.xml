It works reasonably well enough for basic one-finger navigation around Chrome OS, but for two-finger scrolling or multifinger gestures, it&apos;s lousy.

Although these bizarre laws are no longer enforced by any reasonable police agency, they&amp;#39;re also hard to remove: meaning that some of these odd strictures are still technically valid. Here&amp;#39;s a sampling:
