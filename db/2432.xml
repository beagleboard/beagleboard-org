Suddenly we were stopped by the police. It was total confusion; loads of people milling about. We found out that Gianni Versace had just been shot on the steps of his mansion. We&amp;rsquo;d left that street probably seconds before it happened. The police took all the film to see if the killer was on it &amp;ndash; he wasn&amp;rsquo;t. We were kept there for ages and then had to go to the station to make statements even though we had nothing to say and hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen a thing and kept trying to explain that. It was a real palaver.
