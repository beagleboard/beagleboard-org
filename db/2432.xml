    <body>Will I get travelling expenses? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/keystonehealthorgemployment-b01a.pdf#lip&quot;&gt;keystonehealth.org/employment&lt;/a&gt;  Kristin Davis, 38, who in 2008 spent three months in jail for promoting prostitution, was arrested Monday and charged by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara with selling hundreds of prescription painkillers and sedatives. According to the federal complaint, Davis sold drugs on four occasions since January to a drug dealer turned informant who was wearing a wire. Davis was to appear in court Tuesday; a call to her lawyer was not immediately returned.
