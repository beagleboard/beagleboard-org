    <body>Hold the line, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/webmailimedcomau-7ef0.pdf#stability&quot;&gt;webmail.imed.com.au&lt;/a&gt;  Although the beautiful muddle of Devlin&amp;rsquo;s brain is in evidence throughout her home &amp;ndash; from graphic print pillows to the tiny model temple she made for Shakira&amp;rsquo;s world tour and neighbouring set of miniature knives from A Midsummer Night&amp;rsquo;s Dream that sit atop the piano &amp;ndash; the perfectionism she applies to her professional life is pleasingly absent. Piles of children&amp;rsquo;s toys clutter the floor and unruly pot plants populate the balcony. &amp;ldquo;I apply the same likes to the space I live in as I do to clothes,&amp;rdquo; says Devlin, whose favourite designers include Rick Owens, Gareth Pugh, Alexander McQueen and Dries Van Noten. &amp;ldquo;They all create worlds in the way that opera or ballet does. But there are the clothes I admire as pieces of art and theatre and the clothes I have to wear to get what I have to do done. Many of the stylists that I know who work with Kanye and Rihanna create looks you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe &amp;ndash; but you meet them and they&amp;rsquo;re in jeans and white T-shirts. When you have kids and you work with glue every day, there&amp;rsquo;s not much point in wearing a £2,000 jacket &amp;ndash; even though it&amp;rsquo;s quite nice to be able to be at the point where you can afford to wear nice things.&amp;rdquo;

If you were doing something as a rookie or a second-year player, move past that, put it behind you. That takes time, but it has to happen eventually or else youâre not getting better.â

Republicans reclaimed the individual mandate as an attack line this month, vowing to put it on hold for at least a year now that the White House has delayed until 2015 a parallel requirement for businesses. Putting off one set of rules while forging ahead with another just isn&amp;rsquo;t fair, say Republican lawmakers, who&amp;rsquo;ll force House votes on each mandate Wednesday.

All have announced plans to run in a November election to fill 14 seats for the 2014-16 period.
