    <body>There&apos;s a three month trial period &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/vitadocscom-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;vitadocs.com reviews&lt;/a&gt;  That is one philosophy. To some degree, though perhaps not as much as Mrs. Lowell, the Bloomberg administration has subscribed to it. The Mayor&amp;#8217;s plan to reduce homelessness has always stressed &amp;#8220;client responsibility.&amp;#8221; In an interview in 2003, Linda Gibbs talked about the new outlook at the D.H.S. She said that a lack of standards had helped to create &amp;#8220;passivity&amp;#8221; among shelter users, and that the new goal was to &amp;#8220;manage this in a way that people change their behavior.&amp;#8221; For the services homeless people were being given, conscientiousness and diligence were asked of them in return. To begin with, they had to look for jobs and apartments, attend regular meetings with social workers, and obey all shelter rules. Their homelessness was mostly their fault, and so their behavior had to change.
