But maybe it would be even more popular if gardeners knew how much interesting biology lurked behind those beautiful flowers. Like several other popular garden flowers, nicotianas (also known as tobacco flower) have evolved very different flowers to suit different pollinators. Pale-coloured flowers, often with long petal tubes and a strong scent, are pollinated by various hawkmoths. But nicotianas are from the warmer parts of the United States, and many species have evolved to be pollinated by hummingbirds. These species typically have red flowers with a shorter tube, and no scent. Similar variation can be seen in honeysuckles and columbines, each with red-flowered species (pollinated by hummingbirds) and pale-flowered species (pollinated by moths). Our native columbine, with blue flowers, is a bee specialist.

He agreed to suspend long-range missile tests in order to receive US food aid in February 2012, only to challenge the US and the other frontline states almost immediately by announcing a forthcoming &quot;rocket-launched satellite&quot; for April, to mark Kim Il-Sung&amp;#039;s birthday.
