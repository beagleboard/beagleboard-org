    <body>Incorrect PIN &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ascfinancialadvisers.co.uk/cefixime-cena-5553.pdf#university&quot;&gt;cefixime precio mexico&lt;/a&gt;  True. But he missed the point. Bloomberg, new to politics and 59 when he ran for City Hall in 2001, has never realized that governing is also feeling your pain &amp;#8212; or pretending to feel your pain. He has gotten a great deal accomplished &amp;#8212; thanks to his smarts, his independence and his wallet &amp;#8212; and has improved his public act over the years. But he has never made himself into an approachable leader, and his intransigence has come at a price. The public ran out of patience with him.
