    <body>Could I borrow your phone, please? &lt;a href=&quot;http://starbizzcon.com/stmap_45db0.html?filagra.p-force.viagra&quot;&gt;truenaturalhealthcare.com&lt;/a&gt;  But there is an opportunity here as well: This menace can be reverse engineered. You can take gram after gram of sugar out of your diet before ever even touching the foods you thought of as sweet in the first place. And by doing that, you can file your sweet tooth down to size. Before long, you will find yourself content with seltzer or even water in place of soda; before long, the dessert you used to like best will taste too sweet. I have worked with patients innumerable times over the years to remove copious additions of stealth sugar from their diets and then move on to the sugar that was obvious. It works, no chemicals required.
