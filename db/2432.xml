    <body>Sorry, I&apos;m busy at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/stmap_a6a40.html?colchicine.cialis.evista.liv.52&quot;&gt;methoxsalen rxlist&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;We are a good club and they&amp;rsquo;ve had some good teams here over the years. As you walk out of the dressing room at the training ground they&amp;rsquo;ve got a team up on the wall - look at that team, it&amp;rsquo;s the most amazing group of players: Gerry Francis, Frank McLintock, Stan Bowles, David Webb, Johnny Hollins, Dave Thomas, Dave Clement, Ian Gillard, Don Masson, Phil Parkes, the whole group of them was just incredible. Good God, look at that team! What would you give for that team now? They could have won the league that year (1975-76), they got done on the last day of the season, so they&amp;rsquo;ve had some good teams for sure and we&amp;rsquo;ve got to build another good team now.&amp;rdquo;
