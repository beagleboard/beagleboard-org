    <body>What qualifications have you got? &lt;a href=&quot;https://leotoys.cl/cost-of-herpes-antiviral-drugs-2206.pdf&quot;&gt;ordering prescription drugs through canada&lt;/a&gt;  The Knicks superstar said the injured left shoulder that hampered him at the end of last season was diagnosed not only as a torn labrum â as the Daily News first reported â but also as a rotator cuff tear. He alone ultimately made the call not to have surgery â something he called âa huge riskâ â and said that, looking back on it, he is glad that he made that decision. If he had undergone surgery, he would not have been ready to start this season. âIâve never been 100% in my life but itâs as good as itâs going to get,â Anthony said Saturday night before the Knicks fell to the Celtics, 111-81, in a preseason game at Verizon Wireless Arena. âI feel nothing.â
