He managed to crawl to another bunker and take it out with another grenade. Despite being weak from loss of blood, Oresko refused to be evacuated until he was assured that the mission was accomplished.

The whole thing is reminiscent of the scene in the movie &quot;Dave,&quot; where the president asks the secretary of commerce to explain why the U.S. government needs to spend millions of dollars to convince people to be happy with a car they&apos;ve already bought while they&apos;re cutting money for homeless shelters.

He is a high-quality young cricketer. In the Champions Trophy match against England he bowled floaty drivel. But I have seen him bowl quick. When he does that he swings the ball late, making him a massive threat bringing the ball into the right handers. He is a young kid who has never played in an Ashes series so will have to expect the crowd to get on his back. They love a bowler who goes for runs. Just look at how the crowds made life hell for Mitchell Johnson. Australia will look to him to dismiss Cook early, as Cook&amp;rsquo;s record against left-armers over the last 12 months is not great. Starc v Cook is like Anderson v Watson. Both are huge in the battle for the Ashes.
