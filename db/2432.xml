The delays could worsen if the shutdown continues and possibly undercut the nationâs housing recovery. Some lenders are having trouble confirming applicantsâ income tax returns and Social Security data due to government agency closures. Furloughs at the Federal Housing Administration are slowing the agencyâs processing of loans for some low- to moderate-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers. About 15 percent of new loans for home purchases are insured by the FHA. The Department of Housing and Urban Development wonât be able to provide any additional payments to the nationâs 3,300 public housing authorities during the shutdown, but those authorities should have enough money to continue providing rental assistance through the end of December.
