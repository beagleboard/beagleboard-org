    <body>Have you got any ? &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/bannerhealthcom-my-hr-ef2c.pdf&quot;&gt;bannerhealth.com&lt;/a&gt;  Last year CPP was fined Â£10.5m for selling insurance against credit-card theft to customers which they did not need because they were already covered by their card companies, and for overstating the risk of identity theft. Their sales pitch was that customers could cover themselves for up to Â£100,000 worth of losses if a card was stolen by a thief who then used it to go on a spending spree.

A lesser-known problem arises in the Pacific Ocean in a central region equal in area to the whole of Africa. Absence of notable tides or winds has made this central Pacific gyre a vast doldrums where all the plastic polymers jettisoned over decades into the sea have accumulated. As they break down under the effects of sunlight they form an indigestible soup of plastic molecules, and studies suggest that for each 1lb of plankton there is approximately 6lb of this toxic flotsam. In this region albatrosses mistake floating plastic pieces for their natural prey and so the stomachs of laysan albatrosses are filled with disposable cigarette lighters.

Canoâs two-out hit brought up Lyle Overbay with the bases loaded and only one out. But lefty Craig Breslow got him to hit into an inning-ending 6-4-3 double play.

The sadness of seeing two Yankee greats leave and walk away. Extremely happy with the way they were able to go out. The only thing better would have been in the World Series.
