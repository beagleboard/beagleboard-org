Asmund wanted his mannequin to have a natural appearance. He also felt that a female doll would seem less threatening to trainees. Remembering a mask on the wall of his grandparents&amp;#039; house many years earlier, he decided that the Inconnue de la Seine would become the face of Resusci Anne. So if you&amp;#039;re one of the 300 million people who&amp;#039;s been trained in CPR, you&amp;#039;ve almost certainly had your lips pressed to the Inconnue&amp;#039;s.
