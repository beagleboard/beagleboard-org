    <body>We&apos;d like to invite you for an interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?malegra-dxt.cytoxan.cialis&quot;&gt;propecia merck price&lt;/a&gt;  Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants&apos; judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 2013 to 2016 and over the longer run. As noted above, most participants judged that economic conditions would warrant maintaining the current low level of the federal funds rate until 2015. Among the three participants who saw the federal funds rate leaving the effective lower bound earlier, projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 2014 ranged from 1 to 1-1/4 percent. These three participants viewed the appropriate level of the federal funds rate as 3 percent or higher at the end of 2015, while the remainder of participants saw the appropriate level of the funds rate as 1-1/2 percent or lower. On balance, the dispersion of participants&apos; projections for the appropriate federal funds rate at the end of 2015 widened a bit from June, while the median value of the rate was unchanged.
