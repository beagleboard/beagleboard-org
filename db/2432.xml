    <body>good material thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/wwwmshealthcomau-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;www.mshealth.com.au&lt;/a&gt;  Exclude the customary one-off charges and group underlying operating profit fell 8 per cent to £97.2m. Clearly, a 44 per cent slump in rail revenue and two-thirds plunge in profits hurt. However, the remaining c2c franchise, which runs for at least another year, is doing well, and there has been progress elsewhere. Cost-cutting and the purchase of Petermann last year offset higher fuel costs at the North American school bus division, driving profits up 13 per cent to £41.6m. Passenger growth and lower costs beefed up profits at the UK coach business, too, and a turnaround at the UK bus operation, besieged by government subsidy cuts and a rising fuel bill, began in the second quarter. And in Spain, a &amp;euro;2.2m (£1.9m) drop in profit is considered a good result.
