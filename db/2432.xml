    <body>The line&apos;s engaged &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?mexitil.esidrix.zestoretic.levitra&quot;&gt;doctors.net.uk/login/login.aspx?go=true&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;What a view. I mean&amp;hellip; Wow.&amp;rdquo; Wow, indeed. And yet, while paying lip service to the wow factor, my eyes were drawn time and again to a mirror within this large and imposing space (all dark wood and bamboo, fancy lattice work and black lacquer, a &amp;ldquo;wishing tree&amp;rdquo; in the centre of the room with branches for the hanging of cards embossed with your heart&amp;rsquo;s desire). Reflected in the glass, from the other side of the room, stood a row of golden, crispy-skinned ducks, and I cannot accept there is any more beauteous view than that. The one problem is that Hutong prices its Peking duck at Â£58. This raises various questions. One is philosophical. Can it be morally acceptable, view or no view, austerity or no austerity, to pay so much for a lone bird? The point must be settled by more powerful minds than mine.
