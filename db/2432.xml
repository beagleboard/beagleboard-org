For example, its app and website do not allow multiple sign ins to help social media managers switch between accounts, or provide any analytics or insights into follower growth, the number of users who have seen a post, or the performance of the account over time. These are features other social media platforms ranging from Facebook to YouTube have, and which could prove a crucial factor in making it easier to incorporate Instagram into digital strategies and convincing brands (which want to see a definite return on their investment in exchange for parting with their cash) to advertise. But White suggests the team is working on how to integrate the features brands want while still maintaining the app&amp;#8217;s uncluttered design and avoiding upsetting its users.
