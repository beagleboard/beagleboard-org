    <body>I&apos;d like to order some foreign currency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?tamoxifen.ciprofloxacin.levitra&quot;&gt;sd pharmaceuticals agmatine 500&lt;/a&gt;  Masters has plenty of admirers who say sheâs been unfairly singled out for criticism. âThe only reason [the FERC probe] got front-page treatment was that Blythe Mastersâs name was attached to it,â says Richard Farley, a partner with the law firm Paul Hastings, who has done bond work for JPMorgan. Thatâs not exactly right. The energy trading investigation received widespread attention because itâs one of several pending federal investigations that raise the specter of misconduct by JPMorgan. Farley is on firmer ground, though, when he argues that âsome people like to demonizeâ Masters because sheâs an attractive woman in a manâs worldâand because of her catalytic role in the 2008 banking crisis.
