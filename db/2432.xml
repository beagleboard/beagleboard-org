Alburquerque struck him out on the next pitch, prompting Ellsbury and Victorino , who was on deck, to bark at the ump after the inning. âThere might have been a couple of pitches that were pitchersâ pitches that seemed to go against us,â Farrell said. âTo say that the umpiring was the reason why we didnât get a hit until the ninth inning, that would be a little shortsighted on my part. I canât say that was a biased strike zone by any means.â
