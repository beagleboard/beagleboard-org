Oakland&amp;#x2019;s pitching has been slumping &amp;#x2014; the team ERA was 3.62 prior to the all-star break and is now 4.53 since (and 5.57 in the last 12 games). Consequently, the team has gone 8-10 since the break . . . Toronto was successful in Oakland last week, taking two of three . . . AJ Griffin has allowed an American League-leading 28 homers. But he is 3-2 in his past five with a 3.80 ERA. R.A. Dickey is second in the league, having given up 25 homers . . . A&amp;#x2019;s second baseman Alberto Callaspo left Wednesday&amp;#x2019;s loss to the Reds with a forearm injury after a play at the plate but says he should be fine to face the Jays. In that game vs the Reds . . . Oakland reclaimed Adam Rosales off waivers from Texas, three days after designating him for assignment. Rosales spent three days as part of the Rangers&amp;#x2019; organization . . . The Jays&amp;#x2019; Brett Lawrie has mounted a hot streak lately, posting a nine-game hitting streak.
