Snowden&apos;s disclosures about extensive electronic surveillance carried out by U.S. intelligence agencies against American citizens and foreign countries have, among other things, created a significant image crisis for the United States abroad &amp;ndash; one which America&apos;s adversaries have used to great effect. Shortly after the leak, for example, Deputy Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Rogozin warned the Russian public about America&apos;s proclivity toward the &quot;manipulation of public opinion&quot; through social media in order to deliberately undermine the structure and values of their state.

They concluded that the best sex they had observed was that between gay and lesbian couples who &amp;ldquo;took their time&amp;rdquo;, and took pleasure in their partner&amp;rsquo;s responses, which &amp;ldquo;goal-orientated&amp;rdquo; heterosexuals rarely did; and they debunked the idea of homosexuality as a mental illness. Yet at the same time they suggested that some people become homosexual because they are emotionally and socially stunted, and they reported &amp;ldquo;curing&amp;rdquo; 67 homosexual men and women with a specially designed &amp;ldquo;conversion therapy&amp;rdquo;. Supported with phoney case studies, the book&amp;rsquo;s findings were quickly denounced by the medical establishment.
