    <body>I&apos;ll text you later &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/lignocaine-yahoo-answers-b1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;lignocaine yahoo answers&lt;/a&gt;  Some of the similarities were literal. Both were movies set in outer space, and if one was hyper-realistic and the other fantastical, they both showed us the possibility of something rich that lies beyond our earthly grasp. Both indeed demanded (and received) an unusually wide viewership in that third dimension. Both are about talented scientists in over their head trying to get home. Both also opened big and seemed to gain momentum as they go. (&quot;Gravity&quot; is on this course, though &quot;Avatar&apos;s&quot; global eye-popping total of $2.8 billion may never be caught by any movie, ever)
