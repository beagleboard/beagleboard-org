    <body>Can I call you back? &lt;a href=&quot;https://muv.asia/stmap_bf280.html?danocrine.levitra.sinequan&quot;&gt;where-to-buy-phentermine.com&lt;/a&gt;  Such anger is understandable. But the good that finance can do has been lost sight of. The industry has become conflated with crisis, bail-outs and bonuses. Finance embraces all sorts of activities, from insurance to asset management to exchanges. The people who work in the industry are not all bonus-laden investment bankers: the most common occupation in finance and insurance in America is the teller: there were more than 500,000 of them in 2012. The industryâs most dynamic areas, from the rise of peer-to-peer lending in developed markets to the spread of mobile banking in emerging ones, are not beset by anguished discussions about implicit subsidies and liquidity ratios. Indeed, the more regulation binds the behemoths, the more lively and important the innovation that goes on elsewhere in the industry. Finance is not just about the vampire squids.
