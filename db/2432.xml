Before McDonald&apos;s automatically included apple slices in its Happy Meals, it had offered them for many years as a substitute for fries, but parents rarely chose them. When McDonald&apos;s tested a Happy Meal version that didn&apos;t contain fries, it didn&apos;t go over well, nor did a test that included fewer chicken nuggets, executives said at the time.

But what Obamacare is about is those 45,000 dead Americans that we rack up each year. When you complain about some aspect or suggest we eliminate all or even some part of it, think about the lives you are affecting. Sometimes we just don&apos;t want to see the bigger picture.

But instead all kinds of special interests and false arguments dominated the debate.
