If industry refused, the NSA had the unique ability to both reward and punish, thanks to its implicit veto power over deals and exports, Reinsch says. Though the public didnât know it, the agency also became a major presence when the nationâs telecom industry went through a revolution, moving from the Bell system to a flurry of start-ups and a blizzard of mergers. âThe NSAâs ability to access [telecommunications data] became a factor in all those telecom acquisitions,â Reinsch says. It and other intelligence agencies âweighed in and said we want to review this transaction. We want to say no if we think itâs a bad idea.â The NSA rarely exercised that right, but its leverage was useful in co-opting the tech and telecom sectors into its plans.

Here his camera snaps the dazzling if momentary energy of the Roaring Twenties generation &amp;ndash; a band of children who had grown up under the black shadows of world war, now determined to strip off in the sunshine, fall in love and dance the night away. These are photographs of the smiling moment, bursting with a contagious spirit of innocent hedonism and youthful joy; they make one feel good to be alive.
