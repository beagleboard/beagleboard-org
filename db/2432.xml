For every Einstein and Darwin there were hundreds of crackpots, such as Percival Lowell, who believed that Martians had built canals to channel water from Mars&amp;rsquo;s icy poles to its equator (although, in his defence, he also funded an astronomical research establishment, the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, which is still operating today). &amp;ldquo;They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers,&amp;rdquo; as the astronomer Carl Sagan put it. &amp;ldquo;But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.&amp;rdquo; None the less, these men and women in their studies were the engine of science for a long time.
