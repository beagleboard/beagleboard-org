We need more public infrastructure investment, but we also need to reduce regulatory barriers that hold back private infrastructure. We need more investments in education, but also increases in accountability for those who provide it. We need more investment in the basic science behind the renewable energy technologies, but in the medium term we need to take advantage of the remarkable natural gas resources that have recently become available to the U.S. We need to assure that government has the tools to work effectively in the information age, but also to assure that public policy promotes entrepreneurship.
