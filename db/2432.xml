 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haroldwhitefuneraldirectors.co.uk/pharmacyorg-bd82.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmacy.org&lt;/a&gt;  the efforts to revive Margate are pathetic - why on earth would I want to see some pretentious art in a cheap and cheerful place like Margate. Its demographic was and still is - the less well off in the south east - but it completely fails to cater even for this now.

Now to me that isn&apos;t bad at all, especially for someone who is in a city where everyone gets paid min. wage. Our economy sucks and if I can make some extra money by watching some adds YAY! I used to do door to door sales and it seems to me you could get 10 people an hour to sign up for this easy. So that&apos;s $10/hr for getting people to sign up!. I went to college and theres a lot of ways to make a crap ton of money off of this!
