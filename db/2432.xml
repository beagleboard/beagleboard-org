The Dubai Foundation has given the Clinton Foundation as much as $5 million, and more has come into CGI through the $10 billion Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, the eponymous creation of Sheik Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai. The sheik is also the owner of the holding company that contains the Dubai Investment Group, which was a chief partner in the Yucaipa Global Partnership Fund that Clinton joined as part of his highly lucrative eight-year alliance with billionaire grocery magnate Ron Burkle. (As it happens, the Dubai Investment Group also owned the Essex House on Central Park South when Band bought a condo unit there in 2008 for $7.1 million.) And in the first five years alone of his postpresidency, Clinton collected $575,000 in speaking fees in Dubai.
