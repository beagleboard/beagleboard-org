The government should reform the law to protect the public from irresponsible militants like Mr Wrack.&apos;&apos;

But the firm&apos;s legendary inertia would stymie many of them. At Microsoft, Windows is inviolable. This is a company that slaps the Office and Windows brand on everything it does (even Microsoft&apos;s user interfaces that have no &quot;windows&quot;, like the one on its phone, are called Windows), and where anything that might detract from these cash cows is killed before it&apos;s released. Given all the money they make, sticking with Windows and Office has long seemed a reasonable strategy, one that Mr Gates himself has advocated throughout the company&apos;s history. But this tension illustrates precisely why he would be so effective. Only he has the institutional authority to liberate Microsoft from the Windows/Office golden noose. Only he could outline some new plan for the firm and command the troops to get in line.
