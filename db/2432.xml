As part of our Tread Lightly commitment, we choose to load all of our services at their origin point for both the outward and return journeys. This means that we effectively cut in half the number of journeys made to our stations to stock our services. Since introduction, our new range of Waitrose food is proving tremendously popular with customers, and unfortunately on this service the combination of a problem with the loading and the high demand over a long journey meant that there was a shortage of products available. This is being addressed by our catering team.
