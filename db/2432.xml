Court records say Palij - born in a part of Poland that is now part of Ukraine- was an armed guard at an SS slave labor camp for Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland until at least the spring of 1943, and helped to keep prisoners from escaping. Palij has denied the accusations. The original order deporting Palij to Ukraine has been amended to allow deportation to Germany, Poland or any other country willing to accept him. Justice officials say none has been willing. A man who answered the phone at Palij&apos;s number had trouble hearing and could not carry out a phone conversation. A woman who answered the phone at the office of Palij&apos;s attorney said he does not speak to reporters.
