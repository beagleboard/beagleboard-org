Before heâs a full player again, Girardi said, Gardner might be able to contribute as a pinch-runner.

That on it&apos;s own would not be a problem. Rugby is, after all, a sport in which every shape and size can find something to do.

Younger LGBT people tend to have come out earlier than their older counterparts, and younger LGBT adults are also less likely to see growing societal acceptance of LGBT people. Forty-six percent of LGBT adults age 18 to 44 say society is more accepting of LGBT people today than 10 years ago, compared to 61 percent of adults 45 and older.
