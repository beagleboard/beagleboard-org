The soul here is the bar, and a satisfying meal can be made of the snacks there starting with tiny sliders of buttery braised rabbit and tart, pickled fennel ($7). They would be sublime, save for their dry buns, which taste as if they had been contracted out to the lowest bidder. A sandwich this good deserves better bread.

America is simply gathering information while China is gathering information and committing mass espionage and theft of everything from management plans, blueprints, bidding strategies to flat out core theft of intellectual property that is costing billions a year in damages and bankrupting our companies. That is just from the hacking but they also have thousands of moles in our best companies, universities, and government contractors and more every year because of our insane immigration policies. All you have to do is go to the Justice.gov website and type Chinese in the search and you will find page after page after page of Chinese nationals who have been convicted of trade theft against our country. And to think, our Senate and OWEbama want to allow tens of millions of illegal criminal foreigners and 20 million through increased legal immigration to come here to invaded and pillage our jobs our land and our resources! It&amp;#8217;s time to make your voice heard, band together in your community and tell them to shut the doors, stop pandering to foreign interests and focus on the American people so we can heal our country and take it back!
