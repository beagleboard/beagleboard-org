Acceptance of Mugabe&apos;s victory will be criticized in countries that say he is a despot guilty of rights abuses and ruining the economy.

We have a lot of discussions and we don&apos;t show any of that footage willy nilly. There&apos;s a lot of thought and discussion that goes into our highlights.&quot;
