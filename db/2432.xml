    <body>Can you put it on the scales, please? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/blue-growth-79a8.pdf&quot;&gt;eu blue growth initiative&lt;/a&gt;  The argument could raise another hurdle for TransCanada in its five-year quest to win U.S. approval for the 830,000-barrel-a-day pipeline. The project is aimed at opening up the massive Gulf Coast refining market for producers of Canadian heavy crude as a way to help cut the price discount on their oil. The draft impact statement, issued in March, concluded that the pipeline would not by itself increase development of the Canadian oil sands, and thus global greenhouse gas emissions. That finding angered environmental groups opposed to the project.
