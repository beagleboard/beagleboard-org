    <body>I&apos;d like a phonecard, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenlamindustries.com/blog/stendra-where-to-buy-0bae.pdf#unexpected&quot;&gt;venta de stendra en venezuela&lt;/a&gt;  However the IPCC report is used or abused, it represents a consensus and not a conspiracy. &amp;#8220;Each of the last three decades,&amp;#8221; it concludes, &amp;#8220;has been successively warmer at the Earth&amp;#8217;s surface than any preceding decade since 1850.&amp;#8221; The oceans have warmed and grown more acidic. Ice sheets are losing mass. Sea ice and snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere are shrinking. Ocean levels are rising. (Compared to its report six years ago, the IPCC has raised its projection of sea-level rise during this century by about 40 percent.) All these things are plausibly related to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases produced in vast amounts by humans. And these trends involve serious public risks.
