    <body>Who would I report to? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brentwood-karting.com/index.php/stmap_6e560.html?plavix.fulvicin.mefenamic-acid.cialis&quot;&gt;menevit how long&lt;/a&gt;  Personally, I believe that the violence in Syria is none of our business. Both sides are factionalized and have committed a variety of war crimes against civilians. The USA should not finaces any faction but at the same time we should not police international arms sales. Let the Arab world must police itself. I have mixed emotions about feeding the refugees. Most are just trying to escape the violence, but not all. In the end we will help feed and care for them and perhaps some of the refugees will come to the US as immigrants. The ruined villages and towns; overgrown fields, neglected and damaged factories, rotten fruit on the ground and stolen farm equipment turned into war machines tell me that many of the refugees have nothing to return to.
