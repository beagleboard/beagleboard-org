You have too much confidence in the ability of science to manipulate the genetic structure of an organism. Genetic science is still relatively young and many unknowns still exist. What if the genetic transfer went wrong and all of a sudden a strain of extra resilient mosquitoes were spread around the plane?. While this sounds sensational, it is no less likely a claim than eliminating a mosquito population&amp;#039;s need for blood via genetic modification. It is not in humanity&amp;#039;s best interest to eliminate any species from the earth, especially one so widespread. While we should still exterminate them locally when they become a nuisance, we should not try to eliminate them completely. The planet exists in a delicate balance and any tampering can have far reaching consequences. For example, eliminating mosquitoes could leave a ecological niche for a pest that becomes even more of a problem. Humanity should develop other solutions besides wiping the mosquitoes out, which would be a massive undertaking regardless.
