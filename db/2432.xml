IMF Director Christine LaGarde spoke of &amp;#8220;massive destruction the world over&amp;#8221; if the U.S. government doesn&amp;#8217;t pay its bills.

In fact, Richardsâ goal in Saturdayâs second period was the Rangersâ first at even-strength in 108 minutes and 34 seconds and just the second in the last 209:14, including Derek Dorsettâs goal 8:22 into the third period of Tuesdayâs 9-2 blowout at the hands of the Sharks.
