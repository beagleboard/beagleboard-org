    <body>The line&apos;s engaged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anupamdebashisroy.com/keppra-dose-drugscom-f2ef.pdf&quot;&gt;keppra side effects drugs.com&lt;/a&gt;  I&amp;#8217;m surprised that the news media hasn&amp;#8217;t pre determined the cause before the black boxes reveal the truth to what happened. I would hope they&amp;#8217;ve learned to keep their opinions to them selves until the facts emerge from the FAA investigation. I am tired of hearing the TV talking heads and inept reporters who know nothing about aviation report as if they knew what they were talking about. As a commercial pilot, I sincerely hope that when you fly on my plane that you remember the 45,000 people who die in car accidents every year. You&amp;#8217;re a lot safer with me than down there.
