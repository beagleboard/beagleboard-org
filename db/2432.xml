    <body>A few months &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sensors.co.uk/stmap_98740.html?ticlopidine.viagra.royal.permethrin&quot;&gt;buy cialis online uk cheap&lt;/a&gt;  Take Mitt Romney (please.) He made some comments that I can&amp;#8217;t imagine anyone I know making. For example, claiming that the only advantage he was born into was being an American. Seriously? I found the fact that he was campaigning to be President of the United States and will make such an insulting remark about half our nation&amp;#8217;s population being moochers repugnant. And then he wondered why he didn&amp;#8217;t win the election? Oh yeah, he figured that one out. It was because Obama offered voters a bunch of free stuff. Romney is not a man with the moral fiber needed to be a good President. And, yes, I realize he wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been the first had he won.
