They had lunch with the children. That was wonderful.&amp;rsquo; During the pregnancy the Petersons were sent the ultrasound pictures via email, which they shared on Facebook.

Annabel felt a surge of recognition when she set eyes on her biological son. &amp;lsquo;He looks like my brother,&amp;rsquo; she says. &amp;lsquo;I lost him in 1995 in a car accident.

Presley holds the record for the most amount of No. 1 hits by a solo artist, in addition to a string of memorable movie roles.
