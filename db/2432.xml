    <body>I&apos;m a housewife &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecorporationbd.com/mediquote-south-africa-aaa8.pdf&quot;&gt;mediquote telephone number&lt;/a&gt;  On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had &quot;inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy&quot;.

I realize it&amp;#8217;s summertime, and maybe standards are relaxed, but, Mark Potter is identified as the editor of this copy. Couldn&amp;#8217;t he have edited this text more carefully?
