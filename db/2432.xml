Economists say that with the internationalisation of the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and the RMB, countries are increasingly bypassing the US dollar and entering into currency swap agreements. These have all dimmed the aura of the dollar as a reserve currency,&quot; it adds.

China, however, was weaker in the quarter, with sell-through down 4 percent from the year-ago quarter, but Apple has earned $27 billion in revenue on a trailing basis in last 12 months. &quot;I continue to believe that in the arc of time China is a huge opportunity for Apple, and I don&apos;t get discouraged over a 90-day kind of cycle that can have economic factors and other things in it,&quot; Apple CEO Tim Cook said.
