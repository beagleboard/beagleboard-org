Unemployed American bus driver Ariel Castro appeared in court Thursday to faces charges that he kidnapped and raped three young women and held them in his home for a decade.The 52-year-old from Cleveland, Ohio did not enter a plea and stood with his head bowed while the court set a large bond of two million dollars per case, effectively ensuring that he will remain in detention. Castro&apos;s two brothers -- Pedro, 54, and Onil, 50 -- were also detained on Monday because they were with Ariel when he was arrested, but will not be charged in connection with the kidnapping.
