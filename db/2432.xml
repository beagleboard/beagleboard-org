    <body>Have you seen any good films recently? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/the-pharma-network-montvale-nj-5168.pdf&quot;&gt;pharma networking events&lt;/a&gt;  She carried on with peas and morels. My next-door neighbour was telling me recently about a morel-farming experiment and how it would transform the world. I was a bit sceptical, and then I tasted this dish, and he&apos;s right, goddammit. It is an incredible mushroom, the Missoni-scarf of the edible world, distinctive and striking, yet it goes with everything. It came with a herby yet down-and-dirty Jersey Royal r√∂sti, a lemon-thyme dumpling, samphire and braised lettuce. It also had milk foam over the top, a touch that experimental chefs love but everyone else thinks looks like cuckoo-spit. I&apos;m going to pass over this, because the rest was so great, rich but green, smouldering and explosive.
