Hyenas are not obligate scavengers, and in fact are the most prominent predators in some areas, way more than lions in those areas. 2. Why would a scavenger, or rather any carnivore, attack the tail instead of any other part of a herbivore&apos;s body? The tail is one of the boniest parts of a body, especially the tip. It is way more likely the bite was a futile attempt to grab an already basically escaped prey item. 3. Tyrannosaurus Rex had a very developed sense of smell. Pretty sure it would be able to tell whether a dinosaur was dead or not. Bodies begin to rot pretty quickly and that makes them give off specific scents that a scavenger would have to know how to detect.
