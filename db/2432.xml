    <body>Do you need a work permit? &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkph.net/privacy-policy/&quot;&gt;celebrex ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt;  The current visitor centre &amp;ndash; little more than a collection of portable buildings and lavatories arranged around a car-park &amp;ndash; was built in 1968 and was barely adequate even then. &apos;Stonehenge has been a national humiliation,&amp;rsquo; Simon Thurley, the chief executive of English Heritage, guardians of the stones since 1984, says. &apos;I think it&amp;rsquo;s really extraordinary that the only man-made structure in Britain that is instantly recognisable, from Patagonia to Serbia and beyond, has been treated as though it was a motorway service station.&amp;rsquo; But now, after decades of controversy and failure to find an answer to the &apos;Stonehenge problem&amp;rsquo;, it looks as if a solution, or at least a partial solution, has been found.
