Percy Emert and his wife, Connie, were shocked to find the purple creature in a trap they set to stop squirrels from eating their bird feed at their home in Jersey Shore, Pa. Meteorologists at Accuweather.com said they had different theories about how the squirrel got to be purple. &quot;Squirrels get into all kinds of stuff. He could have gotten into some purple ink or purple paint at some point,&quot; senior meteorologist Dan Kottlowski said on the website. Another suggested the squirrel may have fallen into the liquid in a port-a-potty or something similar.
