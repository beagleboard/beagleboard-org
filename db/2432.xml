    <body>Do you know what extension he&apos;s on? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artistparama.com/what-is-maximum-dosage-of-cialis-5168.pdf#aloft&quot;&gt;how to use cialis soft tabs&lt;/a&gt;  no matter how you look at it, the cost cutting will cost jobs. but, the present situation was created by congress artificially. no different from the mob demanding protection money. federal extortion. if five day delivery will fix it, do it. the system was created for the welfare of all the citizens, not big business. for that matter, delivery every other day wouldn&amp;#8217;t break my heart. making the people come find their mail every day is no service at all. like those self check outs at the grocery store. i pay the same price and do all the work. my business will go to whoever delivers to my door. anything else is not worth considering.
