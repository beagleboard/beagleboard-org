Those chips included dedicated hardware registers that were designed to accelerate software written with the MMX software in mind, a technique that Intel used with subsequent chips up to and including its Core processors. Most of todayâs server chips ship with dedicated hardware logic blocks on board designed to specifically accelerate functions like encryption. Accelerators for technologies like Nuance take the same approach, but are optimized for a single company.

A standout is the improbable pairing of cool, luscious flaps of cured tuna ($15) with juicy honeydew â a nautical take on prosciutto and melon. A restrained, but critical, drizzle of acid and olive oil brings it nicely together.
