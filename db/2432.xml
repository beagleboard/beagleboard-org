ETFs, which aretraded all day on stock exchanges, can see more volatility thantraditional mutual funds (which only price once a day, after themarkets close.) And ETFs track indexes, so a straight bond ETFcan be as risky as a traditional bond mutual fund when ratesrise.

Because Washington takes in only about 70 cents for every dollar it spends, the government could begin defaulting on its obligations soon after hitting the debt ceiling.

Set List Show has been up for a few years and is gaining a reputation for sorting the wheat from the chaff. Comedians take to the stage with no idea what they are going to be to talk about. A series of random non-sequiturs are projected on to the wall behind them &amp;ndash; Hamster Holocaust, Castle of Cheese, that sort of thing &amp;ndash; and they then have to construct, entirely ad lib, a stand up set that addresses those propositions. It is weirdly exhilarating, can get horribly sticky or breathtakingly brilliant, and there is a definite sense that you will have to reach for your steel if you are going to come out alive. Some established names have come a cropper, and some new talent risen to the challenge in style. I love it.
