It&amp;#8217;s like the (very wealthy) owner of a large consulting firm once told me, &amp;#8220;When the economy is bad our business booms because when the board of directors grills the CEO about what he or she is doing to navigate rough waters, the easiest thing they can say is that they&amp;#8217;ve brought in an army of expert consultants to ensure a steady course during tough times.&amp;#8221; This lazy, unimaginative management is what masquerades these days as managerial brilliance. Unfortunately, this keeps the truly brilliant from ever having a shot at running the company.
