But to their dismay, they aren&apos;t transported back to fairytale land. To make matters worse, Rumplestiltskin - aka Mr. Gold - in an effort to gain the upper hand in his power struggle with Regina, has introduced magic into the town. In fairytales magic has its place, but in our world it can have unfathomable consequences. Meanwhile, back in the fairytale land, Prince Phillip awakens his sleeping beauty, Aurora (Sarah Bolger, &quot;The Tudors&quot;), but discovers that he and his traveling companion, Mulan (Jamie Chung, &quot;Sucker Punch,&quot; &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot;), will soon have to face a deadly foe, on the Season Premiere of &quot;Once Upon a Time,&quot; SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 30 (8:00-9:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC Television Network.&quot;
