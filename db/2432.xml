    <body>History &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikasafloors.com/stmap_bdec0.html?volmax.viagra.albuterol&quot;&gt;premastop avis medecin&lt;/a&gt;  Giacino points out that there are still gray areas on the PCI scale. There was some overlap between the range of scores for patients considered to be in a âminimally conscious state,â showing intermittent signs of awareness, such as following simple movement commands, and those who had emerged from this state but were still disoriented and had limited communication. He says this distinction is important when doctors decide whether trying simple communication methods, such as indicating âyesâ and ânoâ with the eyes, will be worthwhile or simply overwhelm the patient. Still, if the results can be replicated in a larger group, Giacino predicts the test could be a vast improvement over current tools for locating consciousness in the midst of damage.
