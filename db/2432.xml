If this man were an England international the hoary pundits would be out in force to say this was an understandable action (void of malice as it clearly was) taken as the only possible action against a ball boy flagrantly disregarding his duties. As it is, Hazard&apos;s got a bit of an arrogant look about his face, leaves half our good honest left backs on their backsides, and is consequentially being branded a thug by people like Piers Morgan. This was a harmless attempt to retrieve a ball. If it was the 70s the kid would have been lucky to leave the pitch with his head.

And when the American people are in the dark, they canât make fully informed decisions about who should represent them, or protest policies that they disagree with. These are fundamentals. Itâs Civics 101. And secret law violates those basic principles. It has no place in America.
