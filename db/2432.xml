    <body>I&apos;d like some euros &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelbedlam.co.uk/stmap_65ef0.html?levitra.aleve.cystone.peroxide&quot;&gt;pharmacie-rapide.net avis&lt;/a&gt;  Usually, the depths of Saturn&apos;s atmosphere are obscured by a thick high-altitude haze. Yet as the storm churned the gases on the planet, scientists were able to use near-infrared color signatures to piece together exactly what this atmosphere looks like. They found that the cloud particles at the top of the massive storm are composed of a mix of three substances: water ice, ammonia ice and an uncertain third ingredient that was probably ammonium hydrosulfide. What is most intriguing is the fact that water ice has been found on the planet, something that researchers had never before seen.
