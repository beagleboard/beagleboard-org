But the free-agent market â where youâre almost always overpaying for past performances with another team â is only the way to go when youâre looking to fill a missing piece here and there, much as the Red Sox did last winter in adding grinder types, Shane Victorino, Jonny Gomes and Mike Napoli, along with closer Koji Uehara. Whereas the Red Sox had a solid nucleus in Dustin Pedroia, David Ortiz, Jacoby Ellsbury, Jon Lester, Clay Buchholz and Jarrod Saltalamacchia, in addition to a fertile farm system, the Yankees are looking to construct a whole new team, from top to bottom.
