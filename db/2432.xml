After leaving from his Vermont home with his wife (Catherine Keener), Phillips is on his way to the Maersk Alabama to lead his cargo ship from Oman along the mouth of the Persian Gulf, bound for Mombasa in truly dangerous waters. Hanks, although clearly an affectionate family man before leaving, handles his role as captain very seriously and sticks to certain guidelinesâmuch to the disdain of his fellow crew members.
