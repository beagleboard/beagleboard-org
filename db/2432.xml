And just as companies often fight with the public at large over how much pollution is acceptable, so too is there debate over how much unfairness is tolerable. Again, keep in mind that some pundits contend that point of view is nonsensical: any outcome of economic interaction is almost treated as if it were natural and is therefore assumed to be virtuous. Others point out how many actors have or are able to get the rules of the game rewritten in their favor, so looking at results is as important, if nothing else because too much unfairness undermines social stability (witness Arab Spring and our own increasingly frequent mass shootings).
