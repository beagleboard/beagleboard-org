    <body>Could you please repeat that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://sjofartsbygningen.no/kamagra-velemeny-7ef0.pdf&quot;&gt;kamagra obchod&lt;/a&gt;  This despite an action which was unorthodox to say the least, involving as it did a delivery stride in which his head was down, his eyes trained not on the stumps and batsman, but the ground. &amp;ldquo;I think if he had gone anywhere else, they would have got him to change his action,&amp;rdquo; says Stanworth. &amp;ldquo;But I probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t skilled enough to do it. So I asked Bob Cottam [the former Hampshire, Northamptonshire and England seamer] to have a look. His view was simple: allow his naturalness to develop. Don&amp;rsquo;t tinker with the fact he looked at the floor, let him bowl as he wants. The only thing we had to change was his follow-through. He ran down the pitch, which would obviously get him into trouble, that was really all.&amp;rdquo;
