Among them were two Chicago friends, Marty Nesbitt and Eric Whitaker, the latter of which attended grad school with Obama at Harvard. So were high school friends Mike Ramos and Bobby Titcomb, who was arrested in 2011 in Honolulu on suspicion of soliciting a prostitute. The Associated Press reported that he pleaded &amp;#8220;no contest&amp;#8221; later that year; Obama has played golf with him at least twice since the arrest.
