    <body>I&apos;d like to send this parcel to  &lt;a href=&quot;http://lemcasesorias.com/index.php/best-drugstore-mascara-and-eyeliner-83f5.pdf#spectacles&quot;&gt;why brand name drugs are better than generic&lt;/a&gt;  And yet, despite the fall in exports, the rest of China&apos;s economy, which is still predicated on demand from abroad, is carrying on as if nothing has changed. Imports were sharply higher in the month, especially of the sorts of raw materials needed for export industries and to invest in infrastructure to support more exports. Credit creation also rose, with doubtless much of it going to support imports and property investment.

But the fact is that the U.S. employment situation is more of a wounded beast than a bull. And it is a wounded beast whose entrails tell a different story, indeed&amp;mdash;one that ties far more convincingly into the anemic sub-2 percent GDP growth rate of the U.S. economy and the sluggish retail sales data we have seen of late. This recently led to the Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s chairman, Ben Bernanke, conceding that he is puzzled by the lack of growth in an economy that is producing about 200,000 jobs per month.
