The very quality that has made him such an incomparable athlete during his whole career is now likely to destroy his slow goodbye. He has always lived in the moment, never really acknowledged the existence of a hitting slump or the demands of the healing process. He doesnât overthink stuff. He works hard. That has always been enough for Jeter, even if things never quite fell into place so neatly for Alex Rodriguez.
