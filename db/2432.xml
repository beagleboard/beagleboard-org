    <body>I don&apos;t know what I want to do after university &lt;a href=&quot;https://paradiseinmexico.com.mx/southwest-correctional-medical-group-roswell-nm-c13c.pdf#there&quot;&gt;southwest correctional medical group wichita falls tx&lt;/a&gt;  What Serge did not yet know was that Goldman had discovered his downloads just a few days earlier, months after heâd made the first of them. Theyâd called the F.B.I. in haste, just two days before, and then put their agent through what amounted to a crash course on high-frequency trading and computer programming. McSwain later conceded that he didnât seek out independent expert advice to study the code Serge Aleynikov had taken. (âI relied on statements from Goldman employees.â) He himself had no idea of the value of the stolen code (âRepresentatives of Goldman told me it was worth a lot of moneyâ) or if any of it was actually all that special (he based his belief that the code contained trade secrets on ârepresentations made by members of Goldman Sachsâ). The agent noted that the Goldman files were on both the personal computer and the thumb drive heâd taken from Serge at Newark Airport. (But virtually none of those files had been opened. If they were so important, why hadnât Serge looked at them in the month since heâd left Goldman?) The F.B.I.âs investigation before the arrest consisted of trusting Goldmanâs explanation of some extremely complicated stuff, and 48 hours after Goldman called the F.B.I., Serge was arrested.
