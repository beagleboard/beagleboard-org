The obesity epidemic is far more alarming than cigarettes. Greasy, artery-clogging cheeseburgers are harmful to oneâs health. Hundreds of studies have proven this. America is packing on the pounds at an alarming rate. The amount of saturated fat and calories in meals dished out at any drive-thru is enough to make you run to the nearest elliptical.

Instead we are attracting foreign investors, French companies, Chinese companies to come and invest in our infrastructure. I think that is a good thing,&amp;#8221; British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters.
