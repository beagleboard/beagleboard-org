    <body>What sort of music do you listen to? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aicpuglia.it/stmap_23970.html?motilium.geriforte.cialis.florinef&quot;&gt;atorvastatin 20 mg tab side effects&lt;/a&gt;  A few months ago, we had lunch with a friend who is a management consultant. He arrived at the restaurant raving about the fantastic experience he&amp;rsquo;d just had at the passport office on Hudson Street in lower Manhattan, where he&amp;rsquo;d gone for a need-it-by-tomorrow expedited passport. Having booked an appointment by phone, he arrived to have his application materials checked by a greeter (lest his papers be out of order, which might hold up others later in the process), who then handed him a number and sent him to a waiting room. Five minutes later, his number was called, and he was asked to hand in his paperwork. Then he was on his way; he had his new passport the next day. There was nothing that McKinsey, Accenture, or any other workflow consultant could have done to improve his experience.
