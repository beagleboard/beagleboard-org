Ketchum calls the  project &amp;#8220;a serious study&amp;#8221; that concludes the legendary Sasquatch exists in North America and is a human relative that arose approximately 13,000 years ago.

That is, it had to be diced, sliced, and otherwise shoe-horned so as to gain ratification. It&apos;s authors and ratifiers were a diverse lot. There is absolutely NO EVIDENCE they foresaw such modern weaponry nor the wholesale carnage made possible by it. But, that is a moot point. Those who contend otherwise, must also argue that U.S. citizens have the right, per their interpretation of the 2nd Amendment, to possess thermonuclear &quot;arms&quot;. So, either state your opinion that U.S. citizens have such an absurd right or accept that the 2nd Amendment confers only a QUALIFIED right to &quot;bear arms&quot;.
