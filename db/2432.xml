When you meet Titania in the play her relationship with Oberon is already in chaos,&amp;rsquo; he continues. &amp;lsquo;She is carrying a lot of pain from the past that she wants to bring out and put to him before any reconcilement can happen, and so you need the quality of a great tragic actress as well as a great comedian to play Titania.

If they&apos;re doing a rapid test, that could be by blood or by swab. There are also different generations of the antibody tests, and some require a follow-up test. So if your doctor gives you a confirmation test, don&apos;t worry.
