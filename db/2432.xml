LeBron James went so far as to say that his wing man âlooks healthy â¦ this is the best Iâve seen him since Year Oneâ of the Heatâs Big Three, in 2010-11. . . . Ex-Knick and former Net Shawne Williams is up for the starting small forward job with the Lakers, which borders on amazing considering how much trouble heâs been in during his checkered NBA career. With three drug-related incidents on his resume since 2007, including an arrest last December for possession of marijuana and codeine, Williams wouldnât be touched by most teams. But he has a friend in Mike DâAntoni, who coached him with the Knicks in 2010-11. âI knew that Shawne, if he gets focused, he can play,â DâAntoni said. âHeâs got a huge amount of talent. Youâve got to know the guyâs heart. Heâs got a good heart. Heâs very respectful. Sometimes heâs gets unfocused, maybe in the wrong environment. But overall I know heâs a good, good guy.â Williams knows the Lakers could be his last chance, as far as an NBA career goes. âIâve been through so much,â he said. âIâve been to the bottom of the bottom. Youâve just got to keep your head down and get through it.â
