    <body>I&apos;m doing a masters in law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikasafloors.com/healthkoreauscom-english-bdec.pdf&quot;&gt;pharmacopoeia.com&lt;/a&gt;  I don&amp;#8217;t have time to write a lot but I think you are conflating control and communication in your argument and I think it would be improved if you looked at them separately. As some have pointed out there are results from computer science on coupling/cohesion and communication that apply. For example, distributed networks (i.e. with low coupling between the nodes) can be more resilient than centrally-controlled ones. How does that relate to your argument about loosely-connected communication/relationships ? (I think the answer will be revealed if you consider communication and control separately). Also some of your arguments seem to require a control mechanism (profit driven) for good behaviour &amp;#8211; there are other ways of modelling behaviour that are very different.
