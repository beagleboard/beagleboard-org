It will be difficult for us and we&amp;#039;re under no illusions. It&amp;#039;s nice to be back.

My instant take on &amp;ldquo;Man of Steel&amp;rdquo; is that it&amp;rsquo;s powerful but deeply flawed. Too much time was spent trying to make Superman edgy. He&amp;rsquo;s not Batman, for cry-eye. He&amp;rsquo;s Superman. And the fight scene at the end was way too long.
