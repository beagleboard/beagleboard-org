    <body>Have you read any good books lately? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabanadolago.com.br/index.php/marche-yasmine-montreal-ab8a.pdf&quot;&gt;marche yasmine montreal&lt;/a&gt;  Trump University had neither a license nor a charter from New York State certifying it as an institution of higher education. In total, Trump University students were defrauded of $40 million, with about $5 million landing in Trumpâs pocket. My office received complaints from many former students. One lost her life savings; another had to move out of her home after investing in Trumpâs mentorship programs. Trump claims that enrollees have given his program a 98% approval rating, but we have statements showing that students were hounded into giving favorable reviews.
