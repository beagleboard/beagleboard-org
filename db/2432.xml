    <body>Could you give me some smaller notes? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/accutane-cumulative-dose-calculation-6865.pdf&quot;&gt;accutane makes acne worse at first&lt;/a&gt;  A: &quot;The Light in the Ruins&quot; was a different kind of project, because it was dealing with a landscape I cherish. I&apos;ve been going to this part of Tuscany every summer for 10 years. This landscape isn&apos;t the geography of my soul the way Armenia is, but in some ways it&apos;s the geography of my immediate family. So many of my favorite memories of my wife and my daughter come from this area. So in some ways when I was tearing it apart and showing the deprivations and the horror of war, I couldn&apos;t help but imagine what it must have been like for so many of the people I&apos;ve met there in my years of visiting.
