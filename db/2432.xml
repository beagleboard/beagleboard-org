I am also a big proponent of using our new drilling/fracking technology to develop massive geothermal energy sources. That, combined with nuclear power generation, would enable us to reproduce liquid hydrocarbon fuels for air and land transportation when fossil fuels run out. The reason long chain hydrocarbons make sense in transportation is energy density. Gasoline has 80 times the energy density of the best batteries today.

When I&apos;m running the trainers say I&apos;m babying it a little bit. I couldn&apos;t tell, just off of running. Overall, I felt pretty good,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Hopefully (I&apos;ll) be playing soon. Get these five games (of his suspension) out of the way, so I can finally be out there with my teammates and get active.&quot;

The veteran showed up to practice with a cast on his right hand after a thumb injury he suffered on Sunday. Coughlin said the injury had nothing to do with the offensive line shift, and he called it a ânuisanceâ that shouldnât affect Diehlâs play.
