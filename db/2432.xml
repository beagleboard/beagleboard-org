    <body>I&apos;d like to tell you about a change of address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarah-hyland.net/download-online-pharmacy-dictionary-79a8.pdf#though&quot;&gt;download online pharmacy dictionary&lt;/a&gt;  Some might suspect that the proliferation of two-earner couples is an explanation. Surely having a spouse who works can make it more difficult to pursue job opportunities in distant places. Yet the percentage of married households with two earners has hardly changed over the last thirty years. Instead, the relevant change is that today&amp;#8217;s two-paycheck married households are about 46 percent less likely to move across state lines than were their counterparts in the 1980s.
