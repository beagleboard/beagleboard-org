Exercising the early termination clause doesnât necessarily mean that Anthony is leaving New York since he can earn $33 million more than any other club can give him by re-signing with the Knicks.

They rely on private donations and are less tightly-knit than earlier protest groups. Their tactics owe more to Occupy London or to anti-austerity groups such as UK Uncut. They are quick at setting up camp sites equipped with kitchens and libraries. It is less certain how effective these groups are at sustaining a protest, particularly one which may require trekking to rural parts of the country to gain support. (Balcombe, less than an hour away from London, is unusually convenient.) With a high turnover of young protesters they can burn out easily, suggests Christopher Rootes of the University of Kent, another green-watcher.
