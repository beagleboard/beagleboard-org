That year, nearly 19 million people lived either in New York or the surrounding towns and cities, and many of them made long commutes to work daily. The average travel time to work in 2011 was nearly 35 minutes, the most of any metro area in the nation. New York ranked among the most congested metro areas despite more residents using public transit to get to work and fewer residents using cars than anywhere else in the nation.

Cutcliffe won the Broyles Award as the nationâs top assistant and took the head job at Ole Miss â Archieâs alma mater. Eli, then an elite prospect, had told Cutcliffe and Fulmer earlier in his recruitment that he wouldnât go to Tennessee, but within days of Cutcliffeâs Mississippi move, Eli followed.
