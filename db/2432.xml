    <body>I&apos;m at Liverpool University &lt;a href=&quot;http://tynerblain.com/blog/stmap_ef2c0.html?penegra.viagra.aristocort.sublingual&quot;&gt;instanatural vitamin c serum uk&lt;/a&gt;  Of course there&amp;#8217;s ever so much more about humans than all that, and claiming otherwise would be like an electrician saying that because computers run on electricity, that makes him a software expert too, when he doesn&amp;#8217;t even know what a data structure is. I strongly suspect the mind is essentially a large part software, and thus mind means whatever we write code for it to mean. Mathematics is not dictated by the chalk board it&amp;#8217;s written on, any more than the logic of photoshop is dictated by transistors on the chips; and so I say neither is the meaning of mind dictated solely by neurons. This idea cuts much confusion for me; I feel no need to reduce all of behavior and thought to animal hardware and chemistry, and can better appreciate the almost arbitrary nature of what we can make up. We are animals unavoidably, but wrapped nonetheless in rich and deep software that is re-written by the world around us, and which we can re-write ourselves to some degree. At which point it is possible to know something of ourselves, because we can consciously write the program and make ourselves knowable, at least in some small degree.
