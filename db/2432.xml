Remember, they don&amp;#8217;t control media now; they&amp;#8217;re dependent upon the media of others&amp;#8230;channels 5 and 32 might be the only cameras that might show up. But I realized this is a different era and I&amp;#8217;m far more entrepreneurial and I looked at Conan, after I grabbed another pint of Ben and Jerry&amp;#8217;s because that&amp;#8217;s usually what I do when I get down, I opened up my laptop and said, &amp;#8220;How many viewers are there of Conan?&amp;#8217; And there were 2.5 million.

You&amp;#8217;re on the no-fly list. Try JFK, buddy.&amp;#8217; The video, which was a joke video, went so viral that we got hate letters from civil libertarians. Then the TSA got so nervous&amp;#8230;
