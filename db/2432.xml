That cookie is really dangerous if they can get a hold of it while you&apos;re using Tor, because it links you to your &apos;non-Tor&apos; identity. Now that the toggle model is gone, and Tor Browser is really good about clearing cookies when you close it, then tricking Tor Browser into telling you about its (temporary, session-only, only gotten over Tor) cookies is much less dangerous.&quot;
