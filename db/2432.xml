However, OPCW and U.N. experts would be involved. American and Russian experts may also participate. The actual destruction and/or removal of the weapons will be complicated by Syria&apos;s civil war. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which grew out of a 2011 uprising against Assad.

First they have to build and test it&amp;#8230;. the test will be noticed. Then they have to miniaturize it enough to fit on a warhead as I doubt a bomber would make it into Israeli airspace. It took the US until 1958 to fit a nuke on a missile. Even assuming Iran benefits from all the prior work, they they are looking at several after bomb development before it can be launched. If things get to that point, I would imagine the world will be in general agreement to go in and take out the program.
