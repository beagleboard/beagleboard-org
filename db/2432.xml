    <body>I&apos;ve got a full-time job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarokasongbad.com/southafricasupplementcoza-e3c4.pdf#column&quot;&gt;preventivemedicinenh.com&lt;/a&gt;  Automotive cameras are showing up on more cars ahead of a government requirement to install backup cameras, which is expected by 2015. But with cameras getting smaller and cheaper, automakers aren&apos;t just putting them on the back of the car anymore. Honda has side cameras that come on automatically when a turn signal is employed, so drivers can spot obstacles while turning. Nissan&apos;s around-view monitor blends images from four cameras tucked in the mirrors and elsewhere around the car into a composite, bird&apos;s-eye view to help the driver back out of a parking spot. The system is available on a high-end Rogue, which costs $6,000 more than the base model. Volvo and Subaru have front-mounted cameras that can apply brakes to avoid hitting pedestrians.
