    <body>I&apos;m originally from Dublin but now live in Edinburgh &lt;a href=&quot;http://teerandaz.com/stmap_131c0.html?amantadine.metformin.viagra&quot;&gt;onlinepharma.4you.com&lt;/a&gt;  But there were those who had doubts about the scientific credentials for their research, pointing out that their human guinea pigs, recruited via a highly skewed selection process, were people who were able to masturbate, or copulate with complete strangers, in a laboratory setting in front of cameras and camera crew while attached to various monitoring devices. To use them as a template for &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; sexual function, as one critic observed, was rather like judging normal singing ability by the standards of international recording artists. In particular, subsequent research suggests that the ability to achieve multiple orgasms is far from normal for most women.
