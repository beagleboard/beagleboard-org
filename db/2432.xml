She had never been abroad before, spoke no English, had no money. Determination was what she had. Her family had been rich in China but when they fled to Hong Kong they had to start again. Her parents, grandparents and seven children all lived in a wooden hut on a mountain. They ate rice, no meat, no vegetables. There was no water unless they went down the mountain to fetch it, no TV or radio. Her parents worked every day. At night they slept with all the children in one bed, Sylvia&amp;rsquo;s happiest memory. Her father&amp;rsquo;s constant message was that education gives power.

All four of them now live with their girlfriends a short drive away from each other in Los Angeles. It is the first time they have all lived in the same place since they burst out of Sheffield in late 2005, when they entered the charts at number one with I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor. It was their first proper single, and the out-of-nowhere feat was ascribed to their fans sharing songs over the internet, a then unknown phenomenon. The songs that followed &amp;ndash; street-real vignettes such as Mardy Bum, When The Sun Goes Down and Riot Van &amp;ndash; captivated and energised a generation like no British band since Oasis.
