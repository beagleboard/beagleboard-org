    <body>I don&apos;t know what I want to do after university &lt;a href=&quot;https://laser-eye-surgery-reviews.org/singapore-polytechnic-pharmacy-course-6a83.pdf#coffee&quot;&gt;singapore polytechnic pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  A photojournalist wrote to me five years ago and said he was worried that the Internet was &quot;diluting the effectiveness of photojournalism&quot;. War photography has been through a crisis. Scenes of war have been restaged, re-framed, appropriated, taken out of context, hung on gallery walls, and passed around the Internet. A war photograph even ranks as the third highest selling photograph at auction. Jeff Wall&amp;rsquo;s Dead Troops Talk (A vision after an ambush of a Red Army patrol, near Moqor, Afghanistan, winter, 1986) is a restaged image of war with a fictional twist: dead men joking with one another. The photograph is important because it asks us to read images of destruction intelligently rather than dismissively. What Capa and Wall&amp;rsquo;s images have in common is that they ask us not to confront death, but to see the potential for life.
