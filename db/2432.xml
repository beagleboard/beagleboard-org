    <body>My battery&apos;s about to run out &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?acetate.viagra.styplon.pentasa&quot;&gt;sbl homeopathy damiagra drops price&lt;/a&gt;  The workers&amp;#8217; grievances are simple: low wages, few (if any) benefits, and little full-time work. In inflation-adjusted terms, the minimum wage, though higher than it was a decade ago, is still well below its 1968 peak (when it was worth about $10.70 an hour in today&amp;#8217;s dollars), and it&amp;#8217;s still poverty-level pay. To make matters worse, most fast-food and retail work is part time, and the weak job market has eroded what little bargaining power low-wage workers had: their earnings actually fell between 2009 and last year, according to the National Employment Law Project.
