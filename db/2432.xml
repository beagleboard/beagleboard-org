But several team sources familiar with their thinking said thereâs no way theyâve radically changed their minds just four games into the season. Besides, the Giants could easily be just one game back in the NFC East by Sunday night, if they can beat the Philadelphia Eagles and the Denver Broncos beat the Cowboys.

She is doomed to be the super-good education campaigner who was shot in the head: &amp;ldquo;In Pakistan, I was just Malala.&amp;rdquo; Whether she wins the Nobel Peace Prize tomorrow &amp;ndash; and no one could deserve it more &amp;ndash; she will never again be just Malala. Yet, by being so extraordinary, in her courage and her eloquence, this 16-year-old may enable millions of girls to go to school, and just to be normal. Her achievements are humbling &amp;ndash; and her father was right. Educate your daughters, they are amazing.
