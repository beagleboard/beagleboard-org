    <body>My battery&apos;s about to run out &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?reminyl.levitra.menosan&quot;&gt;pharmacy buyer software&lt;/a&gt;  There are many recent cases of criminal violence including murder of activist Dr.Narendra Dabholkar.Blaming Home Minister Mr. R.R.Patil is one part. But the Police force is grossly inadequate to cater for the security of rising population. Unchecked migration of criminal elements from Bangladesh due to Vote Bank politics is also one of the causes of rapes and murders in India. Bribing BSF personnel on Indo Bangladesh border is one of the main reasons for Bangladeshis crossing into India.With the help of politicians and bureaucrats their illegal entry is regularised solely for getting votes.This Vote Bank culture was started by Congress Party and now many other parties have also adopted this modus operandi.
