Her most memorable one was in 2007, just after husband Blake was sent to London&amp;#146;s Pentonville Prison. Hundreds walked out her concert as the Rehab star nearly collapsed in tears onstage, telling fans &amp;#145;If you&amp;#146;re booing, you&amp;#146;re a mug for buying a ticket.&amp;#146; Afterward slurring her way through a few songs, she crashed and fell into the guitar stand.
