These communities are not all alike and offer different levels of care and payment models. The most fully equipped CCRCs provide living units for healthy residents but also offer on-site facilities and health care staffing for those needing assisted living, full-time nursing care and even Alzheimer&apos;s facilities. Their strongest selling point is in reassuring residents and their families that a person can stay at the CCRC for the rest of his or her life and receive whatever care he or she may need.
