    <body>Whereabouts in  are you from? &lt;a href=&quot;http://public-admin.co.uk/stmap_3c8d0.html?zyrtec.asendin.flomax.cialis&quot;&gt;cong ty hyphens pharma pte. ltd&lt;/a&gt;  It is indeed, but it&amp;rsquo;s one that this particular 30-year-old actress embodies, to the extent of being described by her admiring peers as an &amp;ldquo;iron lily&amp;rdquo;. The more fragrant quality has been to the fore in her breakout role as Jenny Lee in Call the Midwife, the BBC&amp;rsquo;s rampant Sunday-night hit &amp;ndash; 11 million viewers, exported to 102 countries &amp;ndash; in which she&amp;rsquo;s an exemplar of upright, wasp-waisted, bike-riding, breech-birthing rectitude amid a sea of Fifties East End squalor. But she began her career playing a succession of bolshie teen goths and pole-dancing libertines in state-of-the-nation plays such as Harper Regan and Earthquakes in London at the National Theatre, and it soon becomes apparent that she&amp;rsquo;s implacably drawn to what she calls &amp;ldquo;the dark stuff&amp;rdquo;. She&amp;rsquo;s an avid fan of the dystopian sci-fi of Philip K Dick, and Iain M Banks, and identifies more with Sigourney Weaver&amp;rsquo;s Ripley, the blood-spattered great survivor of the Alien movies, than with, say, Florence Nightingale. &amp;ldquo;With Call the Midwife, I&amp;rsquo;m always keen that there should be some edge in there, to balance out the heart-warming stuff,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Though sometimes I still want to grab Jenny and shake her around and loosen her up a bit. After a few weeks of playing her, I have this overwhelming desire to go out and get drunk and fling myself round a dance floor with wanton abandon.&amp;rdquo; She grins. &amp;ldquo;Some journalists want to put you in a box, and say, oh, she&amp;rsquo;s just like her character in Call the Midwife. She&apos;s actually so far away from me, but I suppose it&apos;s the easy, lazy thing to do. I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly proud of the show, but there are other things I want to do.&amp;rdquo;
