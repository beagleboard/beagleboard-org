Then they tested a flying figure of Ironman. They all flew, all be it differently.

If you ask USCIS officials whether a person with an expired or missing card must replace the card before naturalizing, many will answer âyes.â But thatâs only because the law says you must always have a valid card. However, if you ask USCIS whether you can naturalize without a valid card, the answer is again âyes.â A person with required number of years of permanent residence, can clearly naturalize without producing an unexpired plastic card. Your wife will need some form of government-issued I.D., such as a driverâs license to prove her identity. Evidence that she is a permanent resident will be in her immigration file.
