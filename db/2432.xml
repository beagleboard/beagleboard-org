    <body>Punk not dead  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dollingstownfc.com/apotheke-deorg-erfahrung-6865.pdf#peeves&quot;&gt;apotheke-de.org&lt;/a&gt;  But Kelly is in a difficult position. His bosses made a decision last year -- a very wise one in hindsight -- to leave the crumbling Big East for the stability of the ACC. The scheduling arrangement the Irish agreed to (five annual ACC games) necessitates bumping some existing opponents. But there&apos;s no right answer if someone asks why the Irish are dumping Michigan and not Purdue (84 meetings) or Michigan State (76), both of which more accurately qualify as regional rivals. Fair or not, it looks like the school is &quot;chickening out,&quot; as Brady Hoke put it. Kelly was likely trying to downplay that whole angle in advance of the game, but he only made things 10 times worse.
