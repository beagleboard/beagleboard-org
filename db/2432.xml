    <body>I can&apos;t get through at the moment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chris-cancercommunity.com/nuclear-x-ray-technician-b01a.pdf#holder&quot;&gt;nuclear x ray technician schools&lt;/a&gt;  Shortly before Federer&apos;s last stand in the second tie-break, which astonishingly he won with the loss of just two points, the Swiss master greeted a Murray passing shot with what seemed to be an expletive. There was a suggestion that he was complaining about an element of gamesmanship in the delivery of the Scot&apos;s serve but Murray&apos;s reaction could hardly have been more imperious. &quot;Whatever,&quot; he snarled as he returned to the baseline with another point â and another reason to believe that his progress to the showdown with Djokovic had become a formality.
