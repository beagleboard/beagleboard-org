He&amp;#8217;s putting himself in harms way for things he neither understands nor believes. Republicans have to stop going against the majorities for their own gain. They are subverting the country.

Corruption and cronyism. All very well documented in the Bush&amp;#8217;s administrations. Now Walkers.

As to when that might actually be, BlackBerry is a bit mum. The company indicates that it will ultimately launch both the iOS and Android apps via a staggered, worldwide rollout&amp;#133; but it hasn&apos;t given any possible timeline, save for saying that it hopes to get to apps out &quot;as soon as we are able.&quot;

In contrast, Activision spits out a new Call of Duty game annually. Last year&apos;s &quot;Call Of Duty: Black Ops II&quot; raked in $500 million on its first day.
