    <body>Could you tell me my balance, please? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klevermedia.co.uk/dyma-burn-xtreme-price-in-india-31f1.pdf&quot;&gt;burn xt side effects&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;ldquo;The NHS embodies the social conscience of our country,&amp;rdquo; says Sir Bruce, in his report. If so, that conscience is asleep. By constantly preaching how morally elevated the NHS is, politicians make its users feel bad about complaining. They make nurses and doctors feel self-righteous rather than professional. The other day, someone on the BMA Council declared that the NHS should not become like Tesco. But Tesco, because it is not put on a moral pedestal, is held to much higher standards than the NHS. If it had a waiting list for, say, vegetables, or made old people queue for hours at the cold meat counter, it would go out of business. Yet the NHS does far, far worse, and we are all supposed to coo about its saintliness.
