She couldn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;hellip; Not Lucy, who was very religious, unawakened, very serious, a very good poet. I know how he got her in that car, he pulled that cheeky chappy, &apos;I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a lift love&apos;, and sitting next to him was Rose West with a baby and that&amp;rsquo;s how she got in the car.
