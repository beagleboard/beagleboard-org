    <body>I&apos;d like to send this letter by  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.md-interiors.co.uk/l-carnitine-1500-nutrakey-a6a4.pdf&quot;&gt;triple strength l carnitine 1500 mg reviews&lt;/a&gt;  There are more than 1,850 continuing care retirement communities around the country, according to LeadingAge, a senior housing advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. Half have less than 250 units, and only a handful have more than 1,000. More than 80 percent are operated as nonprofits, the Leading Age says. The average age of new residents was about 78 in 2005 and has risen to the early 80s since then.
