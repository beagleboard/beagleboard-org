Janet Yellen is exactly that. Sheâs been one of the strongest voices on the Federal Reserve Board for job creation and the middle class and has been consistently correct in her economic predictions. Her experience as Vice Chair, and previously as President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, makes her an incredibly qualified nominee.
