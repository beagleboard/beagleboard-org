The economy has progressed towards these levels since the last FOMC meeting. Second quarter 2013 GDP was revised up to 2.5%. The unemployment rate decreased slightly in August to 7.3% from 7.4% in July. In August the Bureau of Economic Analysis also reported a core inflation rate of 1.2%. This progression means the Federal Reserve is likely to begin tapering next week at its September FOMC meeting. Furthermore, the Fed chairman indicated in June that the QE3 tapering would last through mid-2014. As the September FOMC meeting approaches, speculators are beginning to consider a number of asset purchase tapering scenarios.
