    <body>Nice to meet you &lt;a href=&quot;http://oktandrammen.no/drammen-ny/stmap_e52c0.html?viagra.carbamazepine.ponstel&quot;&gt;buy drugs online cheap&lt;/a&gt;  âIâve seen it done,â says Rice, who, ironically, was drafted with a pick the Orioles got as compensation after noted finger-wagger Rafael Palmeiro signed with Texas. âIâve had people tell me I needed to do it. It wasnât fair to me, somebody who spent 14 years in the minor leagues and watched people who did do it pass me by time and time again. (but) for me, it comes down to wanting to play the game the right way and not take any shortcuts.â
