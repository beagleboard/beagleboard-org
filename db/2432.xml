    <body>I want to make a withdrawal &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/bsmedicalinternationalcom-b1c8.pdf#flinch&quot;&gt;bsmedicalinternational.com&lt;/a&gt;  While we&apos;re lingering on the tablet&apos;s front face, let&apos;s see what else is there. One thing you won&apos;t find on the device is a set of capacitive soft keys, since the Nexus 7 makes use of virtual navigation buttons instead. Above the display sits a front-facing camera, but it&apos;s curiously in a different spot than last time around. The OG version&apos;s camera was centered toward the very top, whereas this model puts the lens closer to the display and off to the right. If we had to guess, we&apos;d wager that this was intended to make it easier to take selfies without worrying about your thumb getting in the way, but that doesn&apos;t explain why it didn&apos;t get pushed even closer to the right side of the device, since our thumbs still covered the lens on occasion.
