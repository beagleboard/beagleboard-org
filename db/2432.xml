It vanished weeks later with no official reason given. Conservatives celebrated its removal, which came on the heels of an online uproar about the statue&apos;s location.

And itâs worth remembering, too, that CC Sabathia wanted no part of New York or the Yankees but ultimately âsurrenderedâ when nobody else was willing to come near the Yankeesâ $161 million offer. If I were the Yankees, Iâd tell Boras: âOkay, Scott. If thatâs how you feel, lose our number this winter.â
