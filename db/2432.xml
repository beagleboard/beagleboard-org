Now he has left me. What happens to my money if he doesn&apos;t show up in court? Will I get in trouble for having guaranteed his appearance? My husband is an undocumented immigrant. After he agreed to marriage counseling, I bonded him out. He never went to counseling. Then, one day while I was at work, he cleared out our bank account and stole all of my personal property. My neighbors called me to tell me he was loading everything up and leaving. However, by the time I got there he had taken everything and disappeared! I have tried to reach him without success. I would like him to be deported and get an annulment. His next immigration court hearing is in December, but I doubt he will appear.
