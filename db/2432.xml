The rookie QB had drawn pressure from the blitzing Titans all game long, but on what was supposed to be a screen pass, Karl Klug was almost instantly in on Smith, who attempted to move the ball from his right hand behind his back to his left hand, but ended up fumbling, with Klug recovering in the end zone for a touchdown.
