The shortage of RDTs at this health post is part of a larger pattern I&amp;#39;ve seen play out over the course of my reporting here, from inadequate supplies of insecticide treated nets to zinc to child formulations of amoxicillin, and it&amp;#39;s one that I&amp;#39;ll continue to report on for the duration of my trip in Zambia.

But graphene is difficult to manufacture, and samples almost always contain defects, such as holes, tears and grain boundaries, through which gas molecules could, in principle, seep. Even more defects can be introduced into graphene if it is reacted with an acid to produce graphene oxide, in which some of the carbonâcarbon bonds are broken to re-form with oxygen atoms.
