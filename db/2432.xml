    <body>I love this site &lt;a href=&quot;http://reflectiveteens.com/pwhealthcom-213a.pdf#opera&quot;&gt;medstopnj.com&lt;/a&gt;  In a diary entry dated April 4, 1944, Anne wrote, &quot;I want to go on living even after my death.&quot; And so she has. Her desire was to be a writer and she succeeded in her short life more than many writers who live a normal lifespan.

It is all part of the âJoin the Huddleâ tour that will kick off this week, a four-truck caravan weaving its way through 48 sites â 24 in New York and 24 in New Jersey. It will run until February when it will be parked between 35th and 36th Streets on Super Bowl Boulevard in midtown.
