But it&apos;s a labor of lurch for director Robert Schwentke (&quot;Red&quot;) and writers Matt Manfredi, Phil Hay and David Dobkin (check out the scripts they&apos;ve worked on collectively or alone: &quot;Jack the Giant Slayer,&quot; &quot;Clash of the Titans,&quot; &quot;Aeon Flux,&quot; &quot;The Tuxedo.&quot; Yeesh).
