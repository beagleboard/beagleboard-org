Supporters from Berlusconi&apos;s center-right People of Freedom(PdL) party were livid after the Cassation&apos;s decision Tuesday tostart hearings so soon in a case where the media mogul isappealing a four-year jail term and a five-year ban from officefor tax-dodging at Mediaset, a broadcasting company that is partof his family&apos;s media empire.  His lawyers have called the move &quot;beyond logic,&quot; arguingthat it does not give them enough time to prepare, while theCassation insists the case risked timing out under the statuteof limitations - something that has happened in a number ofBerlusconi&apos;s previous legal entanglements.  One pro-Berlusconi daily, Il Giornale, called the court&quot;State bandits,&quot; echoing the premier&apos;s oft-made allegation ofleft-wing judicial bias.  &quot;We are used to language that does not belong in ademocracy,&quot; said Santacroce.  &quot;All are free to express their opinions, but withinreason&quot;.  Just three weeks ago, Berlusconi&apos;s supporters upbraidedjudges in a street rally in Rome after a court in Milan foundthe 76-year-old guilty of paying for sex with an exotic dancernamed Ruby when she was underage and abusing his office to coverit up.  He is appealing the seven-year prison sentence and life banfrom office.  After the rally, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, whois also the titular head of the judiciary&apos;s self-governing body,the CSM, called for &quot;greater respect&quot; of all branches of theState, which was interpreted as an implicit rebuke of Berlusconito tone down his rhetoric.  Many have worried that the fragile stability of theunprecedented left-right coalition government, which makesstrange bedfellows of long-time foes who finished first andsecond in February&apos;s inconclusive general election, was at riskover the legal troubles of Berlusconi, who has threatened towithdraw support over other issues.  Members of his party have vowed to resign from governmenten masse if their leader&apos;s ban from office is upheld at theCourt of Cassation.  In a sign of the lockstep solidarity the party has longprided itself on, the PdL secured a one-day halt toparliamentary business Wednesday to assess the ramifications ofBerlusconi&apos;s legal challenges and alleged &quot;judicialpersecution&quot;.  But senior party member and Infrastructure MinisterMaurizio Lupi assured that the row will not affect thegovernment.  &quot;We will continue to do our jobs, and go ahead,&quot; Lupi said,adding that the unexpectedly fast court scheduling &quot;does notjeopardise&quot; the PdL&apos;s coalition with the center left.  But it does threaten &quot;democracy in our country,&quot; heclaimed.
