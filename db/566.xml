Most politicians based upon historical facts have not this vital asset and the reason why they get things so horribly wrong time and time again. Mr. Davisâs stance on Syria is just a single pointer to his credentials as Prime Minister Stock and where he thinks like the normal man or women in the streets â that typical individual described in common law who rides the Clapham Omnibus. Therefore he has his feet firmly on the ground, not just because of his convictions towards Syria, but down to the majority of things that I have read and heard from Mr. Davis over the last decade. Indeed his background and upbringing from a council house and his parentâs relative living standards of a working-class family environment (even living in a âslumâ in Wandsworth, London before securing a council house) have in my mind prepared him to be possibly one of the greatest Prime Ministers that this country could ever have if he was allowed to be so. Unfortunately in this respect the elitist mindset of the conservatives where one can see this clearly with the current voted-in incumbents, will in the end in my humble opinion be the road to oblivion for the Conservative Party. For Cameron even if he is re-elected come 2015, will only last for no more than two years as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister. Therefore if common-sense prevails and if the British people wish to see a prime minister that is truly for the people they need not look any further than David Davis. Indeed in this respect also if the Conservative Party have any acumen at all and thoughts for their Partyâs successful future that is inextricably intertwined with their own long-term good, they should look no further either to appoint a working-class boy who knows what life is all about and will deliver the goods.
