The main factors would be lifestyle related eg healthy eating, exercise and not smoking. That is not to say that all poorer people do not eat well or do not exercise or that all poor people smoke. However it is to say that a greater proportion do. As the article says part of this is due to education also. Screening may be an element here also, although the national cancer screening programmes for breast, cervical and now colorectal cancer are all state funded and free.

Kevin Hogan dropped to 10-1 as a starter against a spirited Utah defense. It was a week filled with controversy for Stanford after Washington coach Steve Sarkisian accused the Cardinal of faking injuries to slow down the tempo, leaving Stanfordâs David Shaw to vigorously defend his program. This time, that wasnât an issue. Utah went on a season-long 99-yard drive in the second quarter, culminating with Andersonâs 3-yard score on an end-around.

Figures released last year said the annual number of murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries and car thefts was at its lowest since detailed records were first taken, in 1970. Back then, the county&amp;#039;s 454,000 residents suffered about 5,000 burglaries a year. Now there are 1,020, among a population of 1.1 million. Just like in other areas of the country, however, many gun-owners maintain that they need to guard themselves, their homes and their families ever-more heavily against a rising tide of criminality.
