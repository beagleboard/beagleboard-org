    <body>Who would I report to? &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalelite.tv/fern-c-price-drugstore-b1c8.pdf#secretary&quot;&gt;safeway pharmacy generics list&lt;/a&gt;  The string of comments here are truly stunning. Many people here articulate that the government should take a company&amp;#8217;s money because they have built a reserve. And the people on this website say that is fair and legitimate, because they are not helping someone else, like themselves. WOW! Talk about hypocrasy. As I read the posts, people feel enabled to take someone else&amp;#8217;s possession, because they are down on their luck, or they know someone down on their luck, or maybe they feel their idea of social responsibility out weighs the fact that we are supposed to live in a FREE country, where people have rights. Rights to make their own decisions, like what to do with their own money. Face it people, the money is not yours! You want a say about what corporation does with its money, then become a shareholder. Don&amp;#8217;t sit on the side line, trying legislate your control over other people/money. I guarantee that you would not appreciate someone telling you, to give your money to someone else. I run a small company. We are in the middle of an IRS audit. The IRS&amp;#8217; big concern is we have too much money in the bank. We have 5 to 6 months of revenue. To us, it is not enough. We would like a cushion to survive a downturn, and not have to layoff all of our people &amp;#8211; but the dunderheads like the idiot who wrote the article above, would have you write your congressman to tax our reserve. We would like an opportunity to grow. We would like an opportunity to hire more skilled resources, and take a larger step forward. To do this, we would like a small safety factor. To us 6 months is a very short time in a business cycle. Clearly to people like Dunderhead Johnston we must be JP Morgan Chase. We are, as described by both parties, the fabric of America with less than 30 employees. Smart people realize that the more you pound small businesses down, the more you regulate them, the less chance that they will grow or survive. People stop asking for other people&amp;#8217;s money, property, ideas, etc. Look at yourself, and find out why you were put on earth. Make your own way, most of us did!
