 &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldofrenewables.net/stmap_721b0.html?ursodeoxycholic.aristocort.viagra&quot;&gt;nolvadex dosage during cycle&lt;/a&gt;  (By Kate Carlisle)  Rome, September 11 - Pope Francis said that evennon-believers are eligible for God&apos;s mercy in a letter to thefounder of Italy&apos;s daily paper La Repubblica published onWednesday.  Francis, whose papacy is ever-more characterized by hischarismatic approach and no-bars-held style of communication,was responding to an August 7 editorial on faith and secularismby the paper&apos;s founder Eugenio Scalfari that asked &quot;if theChristian God forgives those who do not believe and do not seekfaith&quot;.  Scalfari&apos;s editorial last month posed the questions, &quot;DoesGod forgive non-believers? Does absolute truth exist? Is Godmerely a creation of the human mind?&quot;.  In another series of pontifical &apos;firsts&apos;, Pope Francisstepped up to the plate to answer Scalfari&apos;s questions directlyby taking pen to paper and writing a letter to La Repubblica.  The daily dedicated cover space and three inside pages to the pope&apos;s letter that began with &quot;Esteemed Dr. Scalfari, it iswith heartfelt appreciation that...I will try to answer yourletter that enriched the pages of this same newspaper with yourpersonal reflection&quot;.  Veteran commentator Scalfari wrote in an accompanyingeditorial entitled &apos;Lost Sheep&apos; that he had not expected thepope to respond &quot;so extensively and so affectionately with suchfraternal spirit&quot;.  &quot;Perhaps it is because the lost sheep merits more attentionand assistance?,&quot; Scalfari wrote.  Francis wrote that &quot;God&apos;s mercy has no limits, if you go tohim with a sincere and repentant heart. The key issue fornon-believers is that of &quot;obeying their consciences&quot; when facedwith choices of good or evil. Sin, even for those who have nofaith, is when one goes against their conscience.  &quot;Thank you especially for the attention you dedicated toreading Lumen Fidei,&quot; Francis wrote to Scalfari.  Pope Francis&apos;s first encyclical, which was co-written withhis predecessor Benedict XVI, &quot;Lumen Fidei&quot;, was published inJuly.  Lumen Fidei is directed towards not only those who arebelievers in Jesus, but it also seeks to open a sincere dialoguewith &quot;those like yourself who define themselves as non-believersbut for many years have been interested in and fascinated withJesus of Nazareth&apos;s teachings,&quot; the pope wrote to Scalfari.  &quot;It was precisely....from my personal experience of faithlived through the Church that I am comfortable listening to yourquestions and ready to seek, together with you, the road alongwhich we can perhaps begin to walk together,&quot; Francis said.  The letter that the pope wrote is yet &quot;further proof of hisability and desire to overcome barriers in dialogue with all andhis search for peace, love and testimony,&quot; Scalfari wrote.  Italy&apos;s atheist association on Wednesday said that whatinterested non-believers was the &quot;concrete application ofdialogue and understanding&quot; for much discussed social andpolitical issues.  &quot;What interests non-believers is beyond the nice words anddeclarations of intent, and is certainly not &apos;forgiveness&apos; froman entity whose existence we do not trust or presumedsalvation,&quot; the group said.  The group underlined that what they held as important,instead, is &quot;that representatives of those religious conceptsapply them&quot;.  Since assuming the papacy, the pope has written heartfeltletters to world leaders like Vladimir Putin, personallytelephoned comfort-seekers like an Argentine rape victim andreached out to embrace disenfranchised immigrants and impoverishpeople in Italy and throughout his travels to date.
