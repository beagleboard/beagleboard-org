While it is doubtful Manziel will feel it on the field, all of the distractions canât help. Christine Michael is gone but Ben Malena remains and he like Manziel is a former Mr. Texas High School player and I look for him to be better this year. Luke Joekel is gone from the OL but Jake Mathews remains and he is more than likely a top choice in this yearâs NFL Draft. Mike Evans caught 82 passes a year ago but Texas A&amp;M have little else as far as experience at receiver with Ryan Swope gone.
