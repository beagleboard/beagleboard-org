With 3 times the population, the corresponding death toll of the US would 228,000. Further, these Mexicans have died so that US citizens can use drugs. US drug users have paid the cartels and enabled them to buy US arms and munitions that have been used by the cartels in their war. If Mexico allowed arms and munitions to enter the US and kill 228,000 US citizens, the US would bomb and invade Mexico. The Mexicans lack the military power to kill 228,000 US politicians and bureaucrats who should be destroyed to bring fairness to the situation. However, the only way to end this &amp;#8220;War on Drugs&amp;#8221; is to legalize, regulate for quality, and tax drugs. That would end the endless, massive expenses of arrests, prosecutions, and incarcerations and allow the US to gain new revenues without raising taxes on individuals and businesses. We would reduce expenditures and gain revenues. We would also eliminate the need for the cartels that are moving into the US. If the US does not legalize, regulate, and tax drugs, the US may bring the level of violence in Mexico to the US, so that Americans can endure 228,000 people killed in seven years. Reuters has a story today about the legalization of marijuana in Washington and Colorado, so the effort may not be too far away.
