 &lt;a href=&quot;http://vegsa.org.au/wordpress/ashwagandha-costco-1a09.pdf#group&quot;&gt;herb ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt;  Phil Hugenholtz, Director of the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics at The University of Queensland, a former DOE JGI researcher, and another one of the paper&apos;s authors reinforced the motivation for taking on this expedition of sorts. &quot;For almost 20 years now we have been astonished by how little there is known about massive regions of the tree of life. This project is the first systematic effort to address this enormous knowledge gap. One of the most significant contributions is that based on these data, we provided names for many of these lineages which, like most star systems, were just numbered previously. For me, taxonomic assignment is important as it welcomes in strangers and makes them part of the family. Yet this is just a start. We are talking about probably millions of microbial species that remain to be described,&quot; Hugenholtz said.
