I mean all of us are entrepreneurs, all of us are collaborators in helping our democracy live up to its highest level, to its aspirations. If you think about this the power of technology and media together is what&amp;#8217;s created really great transformations from our parent&amp;#8217;s generation. Martin Luther King, in the same month we&amp;#8217;re filming this in April of 1963 though, hit a wall. He was imprisoned in a jail cell in Birmingham, wrote one of the most eloquent pieces of literature in modern American history, Letters from Birmingham Jail, but what people don&amp;#8217;t know and if you read some great accounts of this, Taylor Branch&amp;#8217;s book and some others, he wasn&amp;#8217;t succeeding. He couldn&amp;#8217;t get people to organize. He didn&amp;#8217;t have Twitter or Facebook. He didn&amp;#8217;t have a way to affect media in the way that we do. He couldn&amp;#8217;t do a WayWire video. What two ingenious young people, King was young at the point but these folks, Dorothea Cotton, James Bevel were younger than him, and they convinced him to do something which captured the media and transformed the city of Birmingham and brought segregation to an end. They said, &amp;#8220;Let us organize kids, the next generation, and do a kids march.&amp;#8217; The power of Bull Connor and eight year olds and ten year olds and 14 year olds are still some of the most powerful images from the Civil Rights movement with the dogs and the fire hoses. It so captured media attention from the Soviet Union to newspapers in Iowa it was on the front page of the nation. This is the power King knew, if I can be creative in capturing the media and controlling the national dialogue&amp;#8230;I get very upset and this is one of the reasons we founded WayWire&amp;#8230;
