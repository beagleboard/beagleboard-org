Eventually I&apos;ll never know it.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daia.org.ar/2013/index.php/blandford-pharmacy-little-rock-e1c8.pdf&quot;&gt;blandford pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;  The Greek economy will always struggle until the Greek people get it into their heads that they need to pay taxes. I live in Greece and see tax avoidance measures in shops and businesses on a daily basis. I can&amp;#8217;t even get rent receipts here as my landlord is not willing to pay the tax on the rental income. All the shops have signs on the tills that let you know that if you don&amp;#8217;t receive a receipt you&amp;#8217;re not legally bound to pay. However, all these traders keep the receipts that are left behind by customers so that they can hand them out to the next customers. We are seeing receipts dated 2 years ago for goods bought today! With the amount of the bailout received so far (â¬240 billion) and just over 11 million residents in Greece, you would think that the bailout would be making a difference here &amp;#8211; it is not. The roads are still crap, services are still crap and the only jobs are tourist jobs that last for only 3 months of the year. Everybody who works a tourist industry job is paid by the Greek government â¬100 per week for the other 9 months when they don&amp;#8217;t work because there are no tourists. Any offer to try to extend the tourist season is met with horror &amp;#8211; that would mean working outside the summer holiday months for the Greeks and they&amp;#8217;re just not willing to work all year round. The people who are really suffering in Greece are the non-Greeks who have to pay rent on accommodation. The Greeks all own their homes (several in most cases)so can live on summer work only. It&amp;#8217;s the immigrants who do the really crappy jobs for low pay who are suffering in Greece. These people work all summer and don&amp;#8217;t get paid until the end of the summer &amp;#8211; some are living rough because they can&amp;#8217;t afford accommodation withouth regular pay. The Greeks are all doing very nicely, thank you very much. You very rarely see a Greek without a huge wad of â¬50 notes in their pocket.

If the banks refuse to go along, employers should be required to offer their workers other payment options, like paper paychecks or direct deposit.
