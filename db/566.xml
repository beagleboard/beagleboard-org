It was the school shooting and the abortion subplot in season one, it was the sexual abuse in season two. But the first episode of this new season suggests that that ugliness is far more internalized, imbued in each woman instead of in the broader world. Look at the cast of major players. There&apos;s the old woman who literally drains the life out of men. (And there&apos;s Kathy Bates as a Nawlins Countess Báthory, smearing herself in people&apos;s blood to look young.) There&apos;s the sexy, but innocent, girl whose private parts sure are trouble. The girl with Down syndrome who has an almost cruelly ironic gift. The overweight girl whose body means nothing. (Gabourey Sidibe&apos;s character can stab herself and feel nothing, while the object of her ire writhes in pain. &quot;I&quot;m a human voodoo doll,&quot; she says.) For a woman-centric season, the show seems to have a pretty dim, or at least narrow, view of women. I&apos;m not saying they must be treated kindly or delicately, far from it. But there&apos;s nothing thoughtful in this endless parade of Women With Issues, either comically wicked or grimly sexualized. I know that Murphy is looking to explore and upend stereotypes and womanly taboo. But his somewhat reckless methods often end up accidentally reinforcing instead of rebutting or satirizing. At least I hope it&apos;s accidental. The other possibility being that Murphy really does think that stories are best when the older women are sad, scary creeps, when younger women are dangerous little sex sirens, and when women with disabilities or highly noticeable physical imperfections are best employed as spooky sideshows.
