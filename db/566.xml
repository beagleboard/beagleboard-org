Through social contacts with leading local Nazi officials, Schindler had a degree of freedom. He was arrested three times on suspicion of black market trading and other offences but through bribery was able to avoid further investigation. Leon Leyson, along with his parents, became one of Schindler&apos;s workers, one of the 1,100 or so that owed their lives to him.
