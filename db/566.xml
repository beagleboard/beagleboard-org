This is my 2nd day going to my federal job without pay. We were warned several times if we take any leave - vacation or sick - we would be handed a furlough notice &amp; not allowed back until we are called back. That sat fine by me (if I&apos;m not getting paid, then yeah; I wouldn&apos;t mind being home) until we were cautioned a gazillion times that we would be classified as AWOL &amp; the consequences would be determined at a later time. I had scheduled medical tmrw &amp; Friday and HAVE to give them my decision of rescinding my leave. If it were my child, my decision would be an easy one. So I&apos;m worried about that. Plus, our household income will be cut in half since my spouse &amp; I make the same. Last time I was on a furlough during the Clinton presidency, it was for a couple of days (maybe 3-4?) but if messed up our pay &amp; I didn&apos;t see the $ until January. At that time, I still lived at home so I wasn&apos;t overly concerned. Now I&apos;m also worrying abt our health insurance since it&apos;s carried under me. We were advised this shutdown may last a few weeks to a month. So while we are working &amp; serving the public, we can&apos;t help but laugh at the emails from the White House thanking us for our &quot;hard work &amp; continued dedication&quot; while they&apos;re not missing their pay. We even got an email titled &quot;Happy New Fiscal &apos;14 New Year!&quot; Are you f&apos;ing kidding me?? Both sides are liars as far as I&apos;m concerned. And for people who complain, I certainly hope they vote and actively participate in writing/calling their Congressman for changes. I was surprised to find out how many people do not do this. Hoping to hear about a resolution soon (but not exactly holding my breath!)

(ABC), U.S. drugstore chain Walgreen Co. (Walgreens), and European drug distributor Alliance Boots. ABC will likely share the benefits of buy-side cost savings and non-U.S. growth prospects with Walgreens - now its largest customer and expected to become its largest shareholder - and Alliance Boots. Conversely, MCK will solely benefit from these tailwinds, but will also bear fully the risks associated therewith. The overall relative benefits of these two divergent globalization schemes are not yet able to be ascertained, and each will take quite some time to be fully realized.
