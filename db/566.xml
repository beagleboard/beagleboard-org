At least I hope it&apos;s accidental. The other possibility being that Murphy really does think that stories are best when the older women are sad, scary creeps, when younger women are dangerous little sex sirens, and when women with disabilities or highly noticeable physical imperfections are best employed as spooky sideshows.
