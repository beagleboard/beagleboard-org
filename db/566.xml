Not only is the band of lowland landscape that covers its southern border with India a funnel for the illegal trafficking of tiger skins and body parts from India to China but it is also prime big-cat habitat and requires careful management and vigilant policing. Known as the Terai Arc, it is believed to sustain a tiger population of 120, scattered among discrete envelopes of protected area. Bardia National Park is the biggest of these, 374 square miles of forests and river systems where sunlit glades echo to the shriek of wild peacocks, and kingfishers leave blue afterburns in the shadows of the river banks. It is a haven for rare wildlife. In addition to the Bengal tiger, wild elephant, one-horned rhinoceros and gharial crocodiles are all found in the park. A beautiful place, then, but for a creature such as the tiger living here is like living under house arrest &amp;ndash; their natural range would extend far beyond the park boundaries. Across the world, conservationists are trying to reverse the trend that has seen large mammals kettled into ever smaller areas, compromising their genetic diversity as well as thwarting their instinct to roam. In the Terai Arc the WWF is dedicated to creating safe &amp;lsquo;corridors&amp;rsquo; to enable animals to pass between protected parks and reserves.
