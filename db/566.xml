    <body>Will I get travelling expenses? &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldofrenewables.net/is-diclofenac-prescription-only-uk-721b.pdf#deceive&quot;&gt;buy voltaren online uk&lt;/a&gt;  Sure. So we&apos;ve got 4 major themes. Development of our advertising business, in particular, looking hard at digital advertising, really represents a fixed theme, and Meredith Levine who started on Monday, is going to be leading that work. But our 4 growth themes are the development of new paid products and services, Denise here is leading that work. It&apos;s going well. It&apos;s in early stage. We expect, in the first half of next year to be rolling out a number of new subscription intended flavors -- new flavors, new products from The New York Times, as part of our efforts to exploit a broader part of the demand curve of proven and expressed demand for paid products from The New York Times. As I&apos;ve mentioned in my remarks, the international [indiscernible] gets underway, in earnest, in the middle of October, with the rebranding of the International Herald Tribune into The International New York Times, and that&apos;s part of a broad attempt to solidify and unify our products and service internationally, both in print and in digital, on the web, apps and indeed, live conferences under a single brand to find new audiences, new customers for The New York Times, special focus there on trying to, just as with paid products, but this time internationally to find new reservoirs, potential subscribers for the times. We&apos;re also working hard on video. One of the stories in Q2 is of, both a really striking increase -- more than 100% increase year-on-year and video impressions for The Times, but -- and also a more effective monetization of those impressions. But we are still in the position where advertising demand for opportunities for video advertising from The Times is outstripping the supply. Rebecca Howard who we hired from AOL, our new General Manager of Video, again in Denise&apos;s division is working hard on that strategic initiative. I think making progress, but more on that, I hope through the course of this year and into next year. And finally, we&apos;re working on a series of brand extensions, developing -- we hope a broader based Games business, based on the franchise and indeed, the consumer expectations associated with The New York Times crossword. E-commerce opportunities, and also, as I mentioned trying to develop our Conference business, we&apos;ve -- we&apos;re this year, having more conferences both at home and abroad than any previous year in The Times&apos; history, and we think there&apos;s a real opportunity to develop that as a business as well.

The northern hemisphere of Mars, which contains Aeolis Dorsa, is largely flat and at a lower elevation than the southern hemisphere, similar to ocean basins on Earth. âScientists have long hypothesized that the northern lowlands of Mars are a dried-up ocean bottom,â said Mike Lamb, a member of the Caltech team. The boundary between the northern lowlands and the highlands to the south would mark the coastline.

Prices are still about $300 an ounce below this year&apos;s peak.
