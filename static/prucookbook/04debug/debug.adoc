== Debugging and Benchmarking

One of the challenges is getting debug
information out of the PRUs since they don't have a traditional `printf()`.
In this chapter four different methods are presented that I've found useful in 
debugging.  The first is simply attaching an LED.  The second is using 
`dmesg` to watch the kernel messages.  `prudebug`, a simple debugger that 
allows you to inspect registers and memory of the PRUs, is then presented. 
Finally, using one of the UARTS to send debugging information out a serial port 
is shown. 

=== Debugging via an LED
==== Problem
I need a simple way to see if my program is running without slowing the 
real-time execution.

==== Solution
One of the
simplest ways to do this is to attach an LED to the output pin and watch it 
flash.  
<<debug_LED>> shows an LED attached to pin P9_29 of the BeagleBone Black.

[[debug_LED]]

image::figures/LED_bb.png[LED used for debugging P9_29]

Make sure you have the LED in the correct way, or it won't work.

==== Discussion

If your output is changing more than a few times a second, the LED will be 
blinking too fast and you'll need an oscilloscope or a logic analyzer to
see what's happening.

Another useful tool that let's you see the contents of the registers and 
RAM is discussed in <<debug_prudebug>>.

=== dmesg â€“Hw

==== Problem
I'm getting an error message (`/sys/devices/platform/ocp/4a326000.pruss-soc-bus/4a300000.pruss/4a334000.pru0/remoteproc/remoteproc1/state: Invalid argument`)
when I load my code, but don't know what's causing it.

==== Solution
The command `dmesg` outputs useful information when dealing with the kernel.
Simplying running `dmesg -H` can tell you a lot.  The `-H` flag puts the
dates in the human readable form.  Often I'll have a window open running `dmesg -Hw`;
the `-w` tells it to wait for more information.

Here's what `dmesg` said for the example above.

.dmesg -Hw

[  +0.011879] remoteproc remoteproc1: Failed to find resource table
[  +0.008770] remoteproc remoteproc1: Boot failed: -22
----
It quickly told me I needed to add the line `#include "resource_table_empty.h"`
to my code.

[[debug_prudebug]]
=== prudebug - A Simple Debugger for the PRU
==== Problem
You need to examine registers and memory on the PRUs.

==== Solution
`prudebug` is a simple debugger for the PRUs that lets you start and stop the PRUs and
examine the registers and memory. It can be found on GitHub 
<https://github.com/RRvW/prudebug-rl>.  I have a version I updated to use byte
addressing rather than word addressing.  This makes it easier to work with the
assembler output. You can find it in my GitHub BeagleBoard repo 
<https://github.com/MarkAYoder/BeagleBoard-exercises/tree/master/pru/prudebug>.

Just download the files and type `make`.

==== Discussion
Once `prudebug` is installed is rather easy to use.

You can resume using `g` which starts right where you left off, or use `reset` to
restart back at the beginning.

The `dd` command dumps the memory.  Keep in mind the following.

.Important memory locations

|0x00000|Start of the ((stack)) for PRU 0.  The file ((AM335x_PRU.cmd)) specifies

|0x00100|Start of the ((heap)) for PRU 0.
|0x00200|Start of DRAM that your programs can use.  The ((Makefile)) specifies
the size of the ((stack)) and the ((heap)).
|0x10000|Start of the memory shared between the PRUs.

Using `dd` with no address prints the next section of memory.

Here's the shared memory.

You can also use `prudebug` to set breakpoints and single step, 
but I haven't used that feature much.

<<../05blocks/blocks.html#_memory_allocation, Memory Allocation>> gives examples 
of how you can control where your vaiables are stored in memory.


=== UART
==== Problem
I'd like to use something like `printf()` to debug my code.

==== Solution
One simple, yet effective approach to 'printing' from the PRU is
an idea taken from the Adruino playbook; 
use the UART (serial port) to output debug information.  The PRU has it's
own UART that can send characters to a serial port.

You'll need a 3.3V FTDI cable to go between your Beagle and the USB port 
on your host computer as shown in <<debug_ftdi>>.[FTDI images are from the
BeagleBone Cookbook http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033899.do] 
You can get such a cable from places such as 
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9717[Sparkfun] or 
https://www.adafruit.com/product/70[Adafruit].  

[[debug_ftdi]]
.FDTI cable
image::figures/FTDIcable.jpg[FDTI cable]

==== Discussion
The Beagle side of the FTDI cable has a small triangle on it as shown in 
<<debug_ftdi_connector>>.  

[[debug_ftdi_connector]]
.FTDI connector
image::figures/FTDIconnector.jpg[FTDI connector]

The connector attaches to the Black on the FTDI pins, shown in <<debug_ftdi_pins>>,
with the triangle connecting near pin *P9_20* which is the right side of 
the connector as viewed in the figure.

[[debug_ftdi_pins]]
.FTDI pins for the FTDI connector
image::figures/FTDIPins.png[FTDI pins for the FTDI connector]

Two examples of using the UART are presented here.  The first 
(<<debug_uart1>>) sends
a character out the serial port then waits for a character to come in.  Once
the new character arrives another character is output.

The second example (<<debug_uart2>>) prints out a string and then 
waits for characters to arrive.
Once an ENTER appears the string is sent back.

For either of these you will need to set the pin muxes.

It will initially display the first charters (`H`) and then as you enter
characters on the keyboard, the rest of the message will appear.

.uart1.c output
image:figures/uart1.png[uart1.c output]

Here's the code (`uart1.c`) that does it.

[[debug_uart1]]
.uart1.c
[source,c,linenums]
----
include::code/uart1.c[uart1.c]
----
The first part of the code initializes the UART. Then the line `CT_UART.THR = tx;`
takes a character in `tx` and sends it to the transmit buffer on the UART.
Think of this as the UART version of the `printf()`. 

Later the line `while (!((CT_UART.FCR & 0x2) == 0x2));`
waits for the transmit FIFO to be empty.  This makes sure later characters
won't overwrite the buffer before they can be sent.  The downside is, this will
cause your code to wait on the buffer and it might miss an important 
real-time event.

The line `while ((CT_UART.LSR & 0x1) == 0x0);` waits for an input from the 
UART (possibly missing something) and `rx = CT_UART.RBR;` reads from the
receive register on the UART.

These simple lines should be enough to place in your code to print out
debugging information.

===== uart2.c
If you want to try `uart2.c`, run the following:

.make
[source,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]

bone$ *export PRUN=0*
bone$ *export TARGET=uart2*

-    Starting PRU 0

----

You will see:

.uart2.c output
image:figures/uart2.png[uart2.c output]

Type a few characters and hit ENTER.  The PRU will playback what you typed,
but it won't echo it as you type.

`uart2.c` defines `PrintMessageOut()` which is passed a string that is
sent to the UART. It takes advantage of the eight character FIFO on the UART.
Be careful using it because it also uses `while (!CT_UART.LSR_bit.TEMT);` to
wait for the FIFO to empty, which may cause your code to miss something.

<<debug_uart2>> is the code that does it.
